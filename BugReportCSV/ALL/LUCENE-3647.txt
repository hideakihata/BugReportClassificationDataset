DocValues merging is not associative leading to different results depending upon how merges execute
recently I cranked up TestDuelingCodecs to actually test docvalues previously it wasn t testing it at all . This test is simple it indexes the same random content with 2 different indexwriters it just allows them to use different codecs with different indexwriterconfigs. then it asserts the indexes are equal. Sometimes always on BYTES FIXED DEREF type we end out with one reader that has a zero-filled byte for a doc but that same document in the other reader has no docvalues at all. here s the test run ant test -Dtestcase TestDuelingCodecs -Dtestmethod testEquals -Dtests.seed -40a075cbf2de8088 -42be31e45e2a3e63 -1340cc72c4576f5a -Dtests.multiplier 3 -Dargs -Dfile.encoding ISO8859-1 hmm my debugging there is a little bogus just ignore the previous file you can use the existing test with taht seed but i think the synopsis is still correct. I think as a start don t we need to be careful when handling these fixed types in all places Here s a patch for MultiDocValues that should fix some bugs related to this unfortunately the seed still fails . MultiDocValues isnt actually used during merging so we need to investigate other parts too and probably do the same my first guess is that this comes due to the different IWCs if you don t specify a value for a field in one IW before the segment is flushed it will not write anything out. but if for instance in your second IW the last doc in a seg has a value DV fills it with default values for the other docs. is that something which could happen here Same is true if you merge fields ie. if you have slightly different merge policies updated patch... fixes the test fail was a missing break in the switch... I promise I won t write any more patches until i wake up with more coffee or beer. all 3 failed hudson seeds pass now.
