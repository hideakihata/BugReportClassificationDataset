default value with autocreated fields like null
I have a custom nodetype which has two properties both autocreated but not mandatory . If I create the node and want to read the first property not filling in any value I get a javax.jcr.RepositoryException Unable to get value of pages mjo page jcr content mjo title java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 0 Êat org.apache.jackrabbit.core.PropertyImpl.getValue PropertyImpl.java 378 Êat de.freaquac.test.JCRTest.propIterator JCRTest.java 207 After setting the property the exception is no longer thrown. Not sure if this really an error but is a little bit anyoing. Are there any default values null in jsr170 note that a property can not have a null value setting a property to null will automatically remove it. auto-created properties for that reason require a default value. added check in NodeTypeRegistry validateNodeTypeDef method. fixed in rev111271closing resolved issue
