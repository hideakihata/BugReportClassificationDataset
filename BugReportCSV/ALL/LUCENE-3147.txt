MockDirectoryWrapper should track open file handles of IndexOutput too
MockDirectoryWrapper currently tracks open file handles of IndexInput only. Therefore IO files that are not closed do not fail our tests which can then lead to test directories fail to delete on Windows. We should make sure all open files are tracked and if they are left open fail the test. I ll attach a patch shortly. Patch against trunk fixes MockDirWrapper to track open files of both II and IO. Also I ve made the maps private and added methods for removing and IndexInput Output. One test that fails previously failed to delete dir when FSDirectory was used NOTE reproduce with ant test -Dtestcase TestIndexWriterWithThreads -Dtestmethod testIOExceptionDuringWriteSegmentWithThreads -Dtests.seed 2215506388922451011 4021053174950346200 NOTE test params are codec RandomCodecProvider field MockFixedIntBlock blockSize 6 locale el CY timezone Europe Volgograd NOTE all tests run in this JVM TestIndexWriterWithThreads NOTE Windows 7 6.1 build 7600 amd64 IBM Corporation 1.6.0 64-bit cpus 2 threads 4 free 37703064 total 48524288 I m sure there are other tests too.

Patch resolves another leaked file handle. Additionally TestIndexWriterExceptions.testOptimizeExceptions fails w some leftovers. I modified it to use SerialMergeScheduler so that it s easier to debug and it fails on e 0.doc left open. Is that the DocValues file not sure if it was landed on trunk or not . You can reproduce with ant test -Dtestcase TestIndexWriterExceptions -Dtestmethod testOptimizeExceptions -Dtests.seed -226675704182511370 3818287653643995169 Debug-tracing what s happening after the IOE is thrown does not reveal any obvious leak. I can continue debugging it later but if someone can spot it quicker that ll be great. Also shall we perhaps commit the changes to MockDirWrapper II IOWrappers and let Hudson hunt down the failures for us Shai I have a couple of comments first good catch reenable the FIXME is awesome in DefaultSegmentInfosWriter you might want to change the try catch blocks to a simple try finally if succes out.close for simplicity in MockDirectoryWrapper addFileHandle io name you create an exception that always says Unclosed IndexInput which should say IndexOutput if the handle is an index output. I think this could be very confusing if you run into bugs there. simon and it fails on e 0.doc left open. Is that the DocValues file not sure if it was landed on trunk or not . This is the doc deltas file from SepCodec in DefaultSegmentInfosWriter you might want to change the try catch blocks to a simple try finally if succes out.close for simplicity Thanks fixed in MockDirectoryWrapper addFileHandle io name you create an exception that always says Unclosed IndexInput Good catch it s the result of consolidating that into a method and tracking open IndexOutput as well. Fixed Patch includes more leak fixes. Now if you run ant test-core -Dtestcase TestIndexWriterExceptions -Dtestmethod testOptimizeExceptions -Dtests.seed -5142521044628153171 -5513903279645473802 the test fails on CheckIndex which fails on FixedGapTermsIndexReader line 92 the assert . This makes sense since FixedGapTermsIndexWriter failed while it was writing the header. Still need to understand this will dig deeper later. Short summary - we re leaking handles . Good news - the changes to MockDirWrapper catches all of them Hey looks really cool to catch all that stuff. One thing In BlockTermsWriter the success boolean is never set to true Short summary - we re leaking handles . Good news - the changes to MockDirWrapper catches all of them its awesome that you tracked it down some minor things for readability if segnOutput null segnOutput.close should be if segnOutput null segnOutput.close I think you should also do that in other places. Those one line if statements are hard to read and could lead to errors if somebody changes the code later. In FixedGapTermsIndexWriter you do finally if success out.close else IOUtils.closeSafelyNoException out I wonder if we should rather add a boolean to IOUtils.closeSafely boolean suppressException Closable... objs to make situations like that simply a one-liner that way you could do IOUtils.closeSafely success out After all I think you found lots of places where we leak file handles nice.... In BlockTermsWriter the success boolean is never set to true Good catch. Fixed for readability Sure I ll change I wonder if we should rather add a boolean to IOUtils.closeSafely I didn t want to do that since it s public API and I intend to backport these changes to 3x. But I can add another closeSafely variant as you suggest and have the current one call it w false Also I think that closeSafely isn t really safe . If RuntimeException is thrown the code will blow away not closing all Closeables. We need to fix that as well. I m not sure but I think some Faliure objects throw RuntimeException during close ... More leak fixes. Do you think I should commit what I ve fixed already We can let Hudson catch more of these it s fun . Simon I will fix IOUtils as you suggest just noticed it s internal. I ll do that after tests stop failing at least once on my machine . Can we also add a closeSafely others taking Iterable Closeable instead of varargs array When you fix more leaks there may be more places where collections may be used so it would be a nice addition. I am refering to the one place in your code where you added a comment that closeSafely only takes arrays and you had to duplicate the code. Can we also add a closeSafely others taking Iterable Closeable instead of varargs array When you fix more leaks there may be more places where collections may be used so it would be a nice addition. 1 Simon I will fix IOUtils as you suggest just noticed it s internal. I ll do that after tests stop failing at least once on my machine cool thanks calling it with false from the existing API is what I had in mind. thanks Added IOUtils.closeSafely variants that take Iterable Closeable however I m not able to use them If they are called closeSafely compiler complains about bounded exceptions the generic version accepting priorEx . I renamed them but then it complains that ArrayList FieldsConsumer is not Iterable Closeable Ð I guess understanding that AL is Iterable and FC is Closeable is too much. I tried to pass an Iterator Closeable but it still complains. Just to be clear FieldsConsumer implements Closeable TestIndexWriter.testThreadInterruptDeadlock fails continuously still each time in other places. I d appreciate a second set of eyes on it.

So how come it is left open Of course when debug-tracing the test it always passes . Can anyone reproduce and help me w the debugging Another thing to clarify everyone can reproduce these bugs now even on Linux. OK one problem is ThrottledIndexOutput s close method. Right now it sleeps and then closes but this must be done in a try finally because the sleep could throw ThreadInterrupt. But even after fixing that I still see .tiv files left open...

I m not sure how why but somehow there is a DWPT that successfully indexed 1 doc opened the doc stores and then is never heard from again... when it fails it always still has the 5 doc stores open. Somehow when we flushAll at close we fail to visit this DWPT. I don t know where it s getting lost... OK this has something to do w DocsWriterFlushControl.abortFullFlushes Ð that method visits the DWPT in question to abort its flush but this does not close the opened doc store files. But why do we ever abort a full flush... It looks like it happens because one of the DWPTs hits an exc while flushing... I m still hitting an intermittent fail I fixed the last failure mike reported on the branch. If we abort a flushAll and a excp. is thrown in the abort method we were not closing the remaining dwpt in the queues. But why do we ever abort a full flush... It looks like it happens because one of the DWPTs hits an exc while flushing... I think this is the way to go here. if one DWPT can not flush why would be continue flushing the remaining ones. You will need to call rollback anyway or reindex all documents since the last commit. Its unnecessary to flush those DWPT since we are already lost the failed segment. updated patch with everything from our throwaway branch. at a glance i saw at least one TODO involving closing a list of iterable probably can be easily fixed now and a nocommit about rethrowing threadinterruptexc Renamed all IOUtils methods to closeSafely. With Simon s fix the names don t collide anymore. Thanks Simon Fixed to two TODO one other place to use IOUtils.closeSafely collection version. Added CHANGES entry. There is one nocommit but I think it s already handled The code already rethrows TIE catch ThreadInterruptedException t throw t catch Throwable t It s OK if we fail to write this file since it s used only as one of the retry fallbacks. nocommit if this is thread interrupted we should rethrow I think this is ready to commit to trunk and then will start backporting to 3x. Thanks guys for the awesome help Thanks guys for the awesome help awesome teamwork - I love it I think this is ready to commit to trunk and then will start backporting to 3x. 1 to commit I updated the patch to include the missing MockLockFactory.java don t forget to svn add MockLockFactoryWrapper accidentally omitted from previous patch. Committed revision 1128830 to trunk. I will now backport to 3x. But why do we ever abort a full flush... It looks like it happens because one of the DWPTs hits an exc while flushing... I think this is the way to go here. if one DWPT can not flush why would be continue flushing the remaining ones. You will need to call rollback anyway or reindex all documents since the last commit. Its unnecessary to flush those DWPT since we are already lost the failed segment. In theory if disk space freed up the other DWPTs could flush Ie the failure of one DWPT to flush should only have to above that one DWPT But I agree I think it s OK if we leave it this way for now... you re right that the app is going to have to do its own recovery anyway. Just feels like we shouldn t be discarding healthy DWPTs... but I think it s minor. Changes backported from trunk. I think I found another leak in IndexWriter.closeMergeReaders not fixed on trunk yet Ð if suppressExceptions was false it could fail on a release close attempt w o releasing closing all of the pooled readers. I modified the method to remove a lot of code duplication so I d appreciate a second eye on it. All tests pass at least so far . So if there are no objections I ll commit to 3x and port the IW fix to trunk as well. Nice catch in closeMergeReaders Ð the changes there look great. Much less code dup now You need to svn add MockLockFWWrapper.java. Also why do we call checkpoint only if suppressWarnings true and not only if anyChanges true Why do we care about suppressWarnings or not From what I read the two are equivalent in that context b c drop suppressWarnings which means anyChanges false whenever drop true ... It s weird about MLFWrapper - when I svn stat it appears w A and not . Yet svn diff MLFW yields no diff ... If I svn ci I see that it s included in the list of files ... strange. Also why do we call checkpoint only if suppressWarnings true and not only if anyChanges true Good question My guess is the checkpoint can be removed We call checkpoint up above after closeMergeReaders unconditionally... It s weird about MLFWrapper - when I svn stat it appears w A and not . Yet svn diff MLFW yields no diff ... If I svn ci I see that it s included in the list of files ... strange. Ahh yes OK. This is from svn merge I think Like svn diff won t show it... maybe there s some option to svn diff to show these added due to merge changes ok I removed the call to checkpoint and do not track anyChanges anymore. I tried svn diff force but still nothing. And yes it s an svn merge that I did. I guess we don t post patches after backport very often so not a biggy. I ll commit shortly. Hmm ... I think checkpoint is needed after all.

And the exception suggests that IFD does not know about a certain file and checkpoint calls deleter.refresh. So I ll revert my change to trunk and call checkpoint if anyChanges suppressExceptions. I don t want to change previous behavior. Ahh OK it is in fact necessary. It s because closeMergeReaders is also called from the finally clause when there is an exception hence the suppressExcs true and checkpoint is NOT then called from that location so we do need to call it inside here. Alternatively we could always call it inside closeMergeReaders but then not above inside commitMerge . Or we can leave it be for now I prefer that it s always called outside of closeMergeReaders. That s practically what happens already checkpoint is either called outside or inside in confusing code so why not make it explicit and remove the confusing code Well... the problem is mergeMiddle isn t sync d But we could wrap the call to closeMergeReaders in sync block and put the checkpoint inside that Backported to 3x from trunk. I decided to keep IW.closeMergeReaders as it is. Thanks Mike Robert and Simon. This was great teamwork Bulk closing for 3.2
