PROPPATCH error marshalling when the resource can t be modified in general
Litmus test case notowner modify see http mail-archives.apache.org mod mbox jackrabbit-dev 200604.mbox 3c4432A7CF.30008 gmx.de 3e gt complains about a 423 Locked status code being sent back inside a 207 Multistatus   9. notowner modify....... WARNING PROPPATCH failed with 0 not 423      ...................... pass with 1 warning I think that warning is correct as this is an error condition that doesn t need to be marshalled inside multistatus 1 it affects the resource at the Request URI and only that 2 the operation failed completely . Let me also note that none of the other servers I tested with do return a 207 here MS IIS Apache moddav Xythos SAP Netweaver KM RFC2518bis will hopefully clarify error marshalling for PROPPATCH. From the source code the current server behaviour is fully intentional by specifically catching the DavException and using it in MultiStatus . Removing that code seems to fix the issue. takes out the additional exception handling that causes the status code to appear inside a multistatus response issue has been fixed with rev. 397835 398931
