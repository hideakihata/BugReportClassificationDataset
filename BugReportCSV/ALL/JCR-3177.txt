Remove jdk 1.4 restriction for jcr-tests
This restriction only exist because these tests form the TCK for JSR-283 which needed to support JDK 1.4. If maintenance on the JSR-283 TCK is needed it can happen in a previous branch 2.3 . 1 We even had jackrabbit-jcr-tests targeting Java 5 earlier but had to switch back to 1.4 before Jackrabbit 2.0 see JCR-2100 so the TCK could be used to test possible Java 1.4 implementations of JSR 283. AFAIUI no future JCR version will target Java 1.4 anymore so switching to Java 5 is quite OK. I ve removed the Hudson Jenkins build from JCR-2100.
