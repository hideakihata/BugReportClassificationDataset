SloppyPhraseScorer returns non-deterministic results for queries with many repeats
Proximity queries with many repeats four or more based on my testing return non-deterministic results. I run the same query multiple times with the same data set and get different results. So far I ve reproduced this with Solr 1.4.1 3.1 3.2 3.3 and latest 4.0 trunk. Steps to reproduce using the Solr example 1 In solrconfig.xml set queryResultCache size to 0. 2 Add some documents with text dog dog dog and dog dog dog dog . http localhost 8983 solr update stream.body 3Cadd 3E 3Cdoc 3E 3Cfield 20name 22id 22 3E1 3C field 3E 3Cfield 20name 22text 22 3Edog 20dog 20dog 3C field 3E 3C doc 3E 3Cdoc 3E 3Cfield 20name 22id 22 3E2 3C field 3E 3Cfield 20name 22text 22 3Edog 20dog 20dog 20dog 3C field 3E 3C doc 3E 3C add 3E commit true 3 Do a dog dog dog dog 1 query. http localhost 8983 solr select q 22dog 20dog 20dog 20dog 22 1 4 Repeat step 3 many times. Expected results The document with id 2 should be returned. Actual results The document with id 2 is always returned. The document with id 1 is sometimes returned. Different proximity values show the same bug - dog dog dog dog 5 dog dog dog dog 100 etc show the same behavior. So far I ve traced it down to the repeats array in SloppyPhraseScorer.initPhrasePositions - depending on the order of the elements in this array the document may or may not match. I think the HashSet may be to blame but I m not sure - that at least seems to be where the non-determinism is coming from. This issue could also be related to LUCENE-3215 in some cases with repeats sloppy phrasescorer returns scores of Infinity... what scores are you getting However I don t think its a duplicate issue with LUCENE-3215 the issue is when you have sloppyphrasequery repeats positionIncrements 1 e.g. stopwords and enablePositionIncrements true the default Here s the debugQuery output from when it matched both docs lst name explain str name 2 1.1890696 MATCH weight text dog dog dog dog 1 in 1 DefaultSimilarity result of 1.1890696 score doc 1 freq 1.0 phraseFreq 1.0 product of 0.99999994 queryWeight product of 2.3781395 idf sum of 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.42049676 queryNorm 1.1890697 fieldWeight in 1 product of 1.0 tf freq 1.0 with freq of 1.0 phraseFreq 1.0 2.3781395 idf sum of 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5 fieldNorm doc 1 str str name 1 0.8407992 MATCH weight text dog dog dog dog 1 in 0 DefaultSimilarity result of 0.8407992 score doc 0 freq 0.5 phraseFreq 0.5 product of 0.99999994 queryWeight product of 2.3781395 idf sum of 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.42049676 queryNorm 0.8407993 fieldWeight in 0 product of 0.70710677 tf freq 0.5 with freq of 0.5 phraseFreq 0.5 2.3781395 idf sum of 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5 fieldNorm doc 0 str lst Sometimes when it matches both docs I ll get no matching term for the second one lst name explain str name 2 1.1890696 MATCH weight text dog dog dog dog 1 in 1 DefaultSimilarity result of 1.1890696 score doc 1 freq 1.0 phraseFreq 1.0 product of 0.99999994 queryWeight product of 2.3781395 idf sum of 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.42049676 queryNorm 1.1890697 fieldWeight in 1 product of 1.0 tf freq 1.0 with freq of 1.0 phraseFreq 1.0 2.3781395 idf sum of 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5945349 idf docFreq 2 maxDocs 2 0.5 fieldNorm doc 1 str str name 1 0.0 NON-MATCH no matching term str lst I am able to see this inconsistent behavior Attached patch contains a test that fails on this. The test currently prints the trial number and the first loop always pass in all 30 trials expected while the second loop always fail for me but is inconsistent about when it fails. Sometimes it fails on the first iteration. Some other times it fails on the 3rd 9th etc. Quite peculiar... investigating... Attached patch with fix to this bug. The fix is rather simple - just process PP s in offset order. That is when avoiding conflicts a conflict means more than a single query PP is landing on the same doc TP make sure to handle PPs in a specific order from first in query to last in query. This is crucial because the check for conflicts returns the PP with greater offset and that one is advanced. It was pretty quick to fix this but took longer to justify the fix. I added some explanations in the code so that next time justification would be faster and also renamed termPositionsDiffer to termPositionsConflict which more accurately describes the logic of that method. now need to see if this fix is also related to LUCENE-3215. Thanks Doron. I ve tried applying your patch to Solr 3.2 and it is working well so far. Thanks Michael for verifying this I ll go ahead and commit. Fix committed r1166541 - trunk r1166563 - 3x fix not included in 3.4 RC therefore marked as 3.5 above Bulk close after release of 3.5
