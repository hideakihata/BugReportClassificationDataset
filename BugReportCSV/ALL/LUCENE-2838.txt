ConstantScoreQuery should directly support wrapping Query and simply strip off scores
Especially in MultiTermQuery rewrite modes we often simply need to strip off scores from Queries and make them constant score. Currently the code to do this looks quite ugly new ConstantScoreQuery new QueryWrapperFilter query As the name says QueryWrapperFilter should make any other Query constant score so why does it not take a Query as ctor param This question was aldso asked quite often by my customers and is simply correct if you think about it. Looking closer into the code it is clear that this would also speed up MTQs One additional wrapping and method calls can be removed Maybe we can even deprecate QueryWrapperFilter in 3.1 now it s now only used in tests and the use-case for this class is not really available and LUCENE-2831 does not need the stupid hack to make Simon s assertions pass CSQ now supports out-of-order scoring and topLevel scoring so a CSQ on top-level now directly feeds the Collector. For that a small trick is used The score Collector calls are directly delegated and the scores are stripped by wrapping the setScorer method in Collector During that I found a visibility bug in Scorer LUCENE-2839 The method boolean score Collector collector int max int firstDocID should be public not protected as its not solely intended to be overridden by subclasses and is called from other classes too This leads to no compiler bugs as the other classes that calls it is mainly BooleanScorer 2 and thats in same package but visibility is wrong. I will open an issue for that and fix it at least in trunk where we have no backwards-requirement. Cleaned up patch removed a useless testcase no longer needed added test for CSQ that checks equals and hashCode code cleanup javadocs I will commit this if nobody objects to 3.x and trunk. About deprecating QWF we should discuss in separate issues maybe we can merge Filter and Query before 4.0 After thinking one day about it I found some problems with the collector hack and this style of decorator pattern If you wrap multiple times the setScorer method in the wrapped collector may set the wrong scorer you see this if you wrap multiple ConstantScoreQueries on top of each other then the boost of the inner one is returned. The problem is that the score Collector method inverts the decorator pattern. The inner scorer like BoolenScorer with its buckets may set a different scorer in the collector than itsself that implements doc different so setting the ConstantScorer always as collector s scorer can lead to wrong results we dont see this in the test as no collector uses Scorer.doc only Scorer.score which returns constant . I changed the code so CSQ now passes always topScorer false to Weight.scorer of the wrapped query and does not overwrite score Collector ... methods. It still allows out-of-order collection. Now BooleanScorer2 is always used with MTQs. The question is would the previous but broken optimization make sense for speed Mike Mark Attached is the correct solution of ConstantScoreQuery with a scorer that supports topScorer and directly delegates hit collection to its wrapped scorer. This enables use of the bucket-using BooleanScorer instead of BooleanScorer2 for MTQs. The test case verifies that the correct boosts are collected and queries wrapped two times with different boosts return the correct scores too. Sorry last patch was outdated... I benchmarked the test and wired the benchmark to use constant score boolean ... I think the changes are in the wind but its definitely no slower... 1 from me. separately at some point we should open an issue to re-assess the cutoff criteria for constant score auto maybe after the termstate thing . we have been hacking on the boolean rewrites a lot and we want to make sure we default to the best performance Committed trunk revision 1054406 Now backporting Committed 3.x revision 1054412 Thanks Robert for building heavy indexes and testing performance separately at some point we should open an issue to re-assess the cutoff criteria for constant score auto maybe after the termstate thing . 1 I ve been wondering about those cutoffs for a while now... Bulk close for 3.1
