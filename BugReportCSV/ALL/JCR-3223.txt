Disallow unregistering of node types still possibly in use
A fix to JCR-2587 never went into the 2.1 and 2.2 branches.Simple fix by aligning code to actual code on trunk.Thanks Since this accidental feature has been out for quite a while in Jackrabbit 2.1 and 2.2 there are probably already users who are relying on this mistaken behavior. To avoid breaking the functionality entirely for such users I introduced a -DdisableCheckForReferencesInContentException true feature flag in in trunk revision 1236709 and merged it also to the 2.2 and 2.1 branches. Setting that system property will restore the earlier broken behavior where the exception from checkForReferencesInContent was disabled.
