Built-in way to do auto-retry for certain status codes
The HttpRequestRetryHandler mechanism is great. It allows API users to plug in their own logic to control whether or not a retry should automatically be done how many times it should be retried etc. That works perfectly in scenarios where an exception is caught while issuing the request. It falls short however in this scenario... If I m hitting a service that returns a 503 I want to be able to retry that request automatically as well. As of right now I need to write my own logic to accomplish that and it s clunky trying to integrate it with the httpClient.execute call since it s my ResponseHandler impl that ends up getting the 503. I can see use cases for auto-retrying upon getting other HTTP statuses as well not just 503. My request here is...I would love to be able to configure either on the HttpClient itself or on a wrapping class or something that a request should automatically be retried if the HTTP status code is among of a set of statuses that I configure. It would be nice if you could set the max of retries an optional sleep time in between retries perhaps optional incremental backoff if you want to get fancy . I m not sure if this is possible but it would be nice if when this type of status-based retry is enabled my ResponseHandler wouldn t even get invoked until retry was successful. Here s an alternative suggestion possibly simpler to build but definitely not as elegant In my ResponseHandler you could throw a RetryRequestException or something like that and the calling code would catch that and do as expected. That might simplify the mechanism so to speak. Anyway I would love not to have to roll my own retry code since I suspect this is something that hundreds thousands of HttpClient users have had to code. Seems like providing a standardized well-written way to do it would go a long way to helping many coders out there. Thanks Probably the best and cleanest way to solve the problem would be a decorator class for HttpClient interface similar to CachingHttpClient. It should be fairly easy to implement. We happily take contributions. OlegSample work for the above functionality. Most of the work is copied from the CachingHttpClient. My environment is not fully functional so I wasn t able to optimize the imports. Please share your thoughts...Looks reasonable to me. I just would make an abstract strategy interface out of ServiceUnavailableRetryConfig. OlegGood idea. I attached the updated path with you comment plus some javadocs and retry functionality updated.Patch committed with some changes. I changed the signature of the ServiceUnavailableRetryStrategy to make it more consistent with HttpRequestRetryHandler. I also did not quite like recursive invocation of the callBackend method. I replaced recursive method call with a simple loop. Please review. I also noticed that the default ServiceUnavailableRetryStrategy implementation was not fully thread safe. Ideally all instance variables in the DefaultServiceUnavailableRetryStrategy should be made final and the class should be made immutable. Otherwise many thanks for the contribution. OlegLooks OK to me...
