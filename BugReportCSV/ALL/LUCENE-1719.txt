Add javadoc notes about ICUCollationKeyFilter s advantages over CollationKeyFilter
contrib collation s ICUCollationKeyFilter which uses ICU4J collation is faster than CollationKeyFilter the JVM-provided java.text.Collator implementation in the same package. The javadocs of these classes should be modified to add a note to this effect. My curiosity was piqued by Robert Muir s comment on LUCENE-1581 in which he states that ICUCollationKeyFilter is up to 30x faster than CollationKeyFilter. I timed the operation of these two classes with Sun JVM versions 1.4.2 32-bit 1.5.0 32- and 64-bit and 1.6.0 64-bit using 90k word lists of 4 languages taken from the corresponding Debian wordlist packages and truncated to the first 90k words after a fixed random shuffling using Collators at the default strength on a Windows Vista 64-bit machine. I used an analysis pipeline consisting of WhitespaceTokenizer chained to the collation key filter so to isolate the time taken by the collation key filters I also timed WhitespaceTokenizer operating alone for each combination. The rightmost column represents the performance advantage of the ICU4J implemtation ICU over the java.text.Collator implementation JVM after discounting the WhitespaceTokenizer time WST JVM-ICU ICU-WST . The best times out of 5 runs for each combination in milliseconds are as follows Sun JVM Language java.text ICU4J WhitespaceTokenizer ICU4J Improvement 1.4.2 17 32 bit English 522 212 13 156 1.4.2 17 32 bit French 716 243 14 207 1.4.2 17 32 bit German 669 264 16 163 1.4.2 17 32 bit Ukranian 931 474 25 102 1.5.0 15 32 bit English 604 176 16 268 1.5.0 15 32 bit French 817 209 17 317 1.5.0 15 32 bit German 799 225 20 280 1.5.0 15 32 bit Ukranian 1029 436 26 145 1.5.0 15 64 bit English 431 89 10 433 1.5.0 15 64 bit French 562 112 11 446 1.5.0 15 64 bit German 567 116 13 438 1.5.0 15 64 bit Ukranian 734 281 21 174 1.6.0 13 64 bit English 162 81 9 113 1.6.0 13 64 bit French 192 92 10 122 1.6.0 13 64 bit German 204 99 14 124 1.6.0 13 64 bit Ukranian 273 202 21 39 Patch containing notes to add to collation key filter analyzer classes javadocs. I also tested ICU4J version 4.2 released 6 weeks ago and the timings were nearly identical to those from ICU4J version 4.0 the one that s in contrib collation lib . The timings given in the table above were not produced with the -server option to the JVM. I separately tested all combinations using the -server option but there was no difference for the 32-bit JVMs though roughly 3-4 faster for the 64-bit JVMs. I got the impression didn t actually calculate that although the best times of 5 runs were better for the 64-bit JVMs when using the -server option the average times seemed to be slightly worse. In any case the performance improvement of the ICU4J implementation over the java.text.Collator implementation was basically unaffected by the use of the -server JVM option. steven you are correct. i should have clarified the gain is not as much when generating keys. but there is still huge gains for runtime comparison. see recent numbers here for a few languages http site.icu-project.org charts collation-icu4j-sun but you should also mention that key size is smaller too smaller term dictionary Cool Thanks for the link Robert. Key comparison under Lucene when using CollationKeyAnalyzer will utilize neither ICU4J s nor the java.text incremental collation facilities - the base-8000h-String-encoded raw collation keys will be directly compared and sorted as Strings. So key generation time and as you point out key length are the appropriate measures here. I ll post a patch shortly that includes your ICU4J link and mentions the key length aspect as well. I ll also remove specific numbers from the javadoc notes - people can follow the ICU4J link if they re interested. Edited title to reflect addition of key length concerns and switched performance improvement column to be percentage improvements rather than multipliers. steven no thank you for running the calculations yeah i think the sort key length is worth mentioning. in practice i wonder how much it helps lucene at runtime maybe for things like SORT at least it would improve runtime performance by some small amount. steven another note i thought i would mention. along these same lines i searched lucene source code for java.text.Collator and found some uses of it the incremental facility . I wonder if in the future we could find a way to allow usage of com.ibm.icu.text.Collator in these spots. this could give some healthy performance improvements. I found it in QueryParser for localized RangeQuery RangeQuery RangeFilter RangeTermEnum ConstantScoreRangeQuery FieldComparator FieldSortedHitQueue FieldDocSortedHitQueue ... i searched lucene source code for java.text.Collator and found some uses of it the incremental facility . I wonder if in the future we could find a way to allow usage of com.ibm.icu.text.Collator in these spots. 1 I guess the way to go would be to make the implementation pluggable. Updated patch including information about ICU4J s shorter key length adding a link to the ICU4J documentation s comparison of ICU4J and java.text.Collator key generation time and key length and removing specific performance numbers. Steven patch looks good to me. I will look at it again in a day or two. simon I committed your patch and removed the last NB in the ICUCollationKeyFilter.java for consistency. Thanks Steven
