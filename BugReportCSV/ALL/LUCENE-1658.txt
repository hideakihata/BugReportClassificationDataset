Absorb NIOFSDirectory into FSDirectory
I think whether one uses java.io. vs java.nio. or eventually java.nio2. or some other means is an under-the-hood implementation detail of FSDirectory and doesn t merit a whole separate class. I think FSDirectory should be the core class one uses when one s index is in the filesystem. So I d like to deprecate NIOFSDirectory absorbing it into FSDirectory and add a setting useNIO to FSDirectory. It should default to true for non-Windows OSs because it gives far better concurrent performance on all platforms but Windows due to known Sun JRE issue http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do bug id 6265734 . Attached patch. I plan to commit in a day or two. Hi Mike maybe not use a boolean for the mode instead an enum enum java 1.5 unless you re going to write it by hand Mike are you going to absorb MMapDirectory into FSDirectory as well It fits when one s index is in the filesystem . java 1.5 unless you re going to write it by hand Lucene has the o.a.l.utils.Parameter class for that whih is used for e.g. Field.Store. maybe not use a boolean for the mode instead an enum OK I ll switch to oal.Parameter enum emulator. Mike are you going to absorb MMapDirectory into FSDirectory as well It fits when one s index is in the filesystem . Excellent point Ð I think that makes sense. I ll fold it in as well. Excellent point - I think that makes sense. I ll fold it in as well. Doesn t make sense to me. MMapD has different characteristics. It can also have it s own configurable properties which are irrelevant for NIOFSD and FSD. For example my version of MMapD uses MappedByteBuffer.load on creating MMapIndexInput. That way the cost of loading stuff into memory is paid upfront on reopening the reader instead of during first several searches. If we want to publish this feature into trunk we ll end up with additional parameter on MMapD constructor that governs whether we want to preload mmapped files or not. Now imagine constructor for FSD-that-folds-it-all which has type and a boolean setting that s relevant only for one of the types. I also think of trying to use mmap for writing. If that proves to be beneficial MMapD won t share much with FSD anymore. In the end I m unsure if it s a good idea to fold anything into FSD at all. Too much different stuff in one class becons for spahetti code I assume your initial aim is to provide users with best impl for current platform without making them think. What about static factory that chooses between several impls We had static factory before it stinked because you had to chose impl through system property it pooled directories and we had no public constructors. But now we have public constructors If one needs he uses constructor directly. If one is lazy and wants us to choose for him he uses old API that simply changes semantics a bit. In the end I m unsure if it s a good idea to fold anything into FSD at all. Too much different stuff in one class becons for spahetti code I assume your initial aim is to provide users with best impl for current platform without making them think. That is my problem with the whole issue too. For me the three directory impl are too different to be merged together. Especially if writing is also affected. Using an additional parameter in the ctor specifying the type of directory is almost the same like three classes with much cleaner code. The only thing you do not get is the automatic directory impl choosing for filesystem dirs. But the solution to this are static factories. What about static factory that chooses between several impls We had static factory before it stinked because you had to chose impl through system property it pooled directories and we had no public constructors. But now we have public constructors If one needs he uses constructor directly. If one is lazy and wants us to choose for him he uses old API that simply changes semantics a bit. That would be great. As the separate public constructors and deprecation of FSDirectory.open is new in 2.9 we can change it. Maybe an automatism behind open if the System.property is unset would be good. Advanced users may still instantiate the directories using the public ctor. In the end I m unsure if it s a good idea to fold anything into FSD at all. OK you convinced me let s keep separate classes. But I d like to split the current FSDir into an abstract FSDir and a subclass SimpleFSDir. Then we have three subclasses of FSDir Simple NIO MMap . And strengthen the javadocs so SimpleFSDir s concurrency limitations are clear. I assume your initial aim is to provide users with best impl for current platform without making them think. What about static factory that chooses between several impls Right that s my goal there should be a single obvious way to ask for a Directory that uses the file system and that way should have good defaults. FSDirectory is unfortunately the obvious way now but it s usually a poor choice. For example my version of MMapD uses MappedByteBuffer.load on creating MMapIndexInput. Is this something you could share Sounds useful Likewise if you extend MMapDir for writing... Does anyone have a strong sense of when MMapDir is is not an appropriate choice I ve seen some users report good performance eg http mail-archives.apache.org mod mbox lucene-java-user 200603.mbox 3C20060313025744.18818.qmail station174.com 3E MMap eats into the virtual memory of the process so on 32 bit JRE that obviously a very real concern. As the separate public constructors and deprecation of FSDirectory.open is new in 2.9 Right we are free to change things still hmm a nice side effect of NOT releasing very often incentives aren t quite right... . But the old API was FSDirectory.getDirectory. I think we should add a static FSDirectory.create that returns a good default impl given your OS. Attached patch I created SimpleFSDir the renaming for FSDir and left FSDir to be the base class in 3.0 it will become abstract . FSDir implements most methods handles locking etc. so the subclass will just have to implement openInput createOutput. Added FSDir.open static methods currently they simply choose NIOFSDir on non-Windows OS and FSDir on Windows OS. I was tempted to choose MMapDir on 64 bit Windows JRE but it makes me nervous... Strengthened javadocs Cutover most unit tests to FSDir.open Yay for base class three concrete impls haven t yet looked at the patch . I was tempted to choose MMapDir on 64 bit Windows JRE but it makes me nervous... Not completely sure why but MMap failed for me on Win32 some time ago Is this something you could share Sounds useful Likewise if you extend MMapDir for writing... It s a one-liner. I can make a patch but while it works better than vanilla MMapD I m not yet sure it s the best approach. As for writing - okay I ll tell you if it turns out to be anything good. Does anyone have a strong sense of when MMapDir is is not an appropriate choice There are a lot of variables. Just as you said on 32bit systems you have to take care of address space. So nice for small indexes bad for big ones. But mmap in Java cannot be explicitly closed it is closed in finalizer so even for a small index if you update really often you can hit an OOM even though you have enough memory. MMapD failed for me on windows. But it is fast. It is absolutely totally uber-indespensible if you have a 64bit system fat index memory to spare and require lots of fast searches. So you can probably enable it for non-Win 64bit Not completely sure why but MMap failed for me on Win32 some time ago I think on 32 bit JRE we shouldn t choose MMap in FSDir.open . It s a one-liner. I can make a patch but while it works better than vanilla MMapD I m not yet sure it s the best approach. As for writing - okay I ll tell you if it turns out to be anything good. Which way do you think prime all bytes up front on open should default There are a lot of variables. Just as you said on 32bit systems you have to take care of address space. So nice for small indexes bad for big ones. But mmap in Java cannot be explicitly closed it is closed in finalizer so even for a small index if you update really often you can hit an OOM even though you have enough memory. MMapD failed for me on windows. But it is fast. It is absolutely totally uber-indespensible if you have a 64bit system fat index memory to spare and require lots of fast searches. So you can probably enable it for non-Win 64bit Wait are you saying Win 64 bit has problems w MMapDir I thought you just said Win 32 bit above . Is MMapDir fine w concurrency I d assume so . So if you had the choice ie you re running in env w plenty of virtual mem MMapDir would be preferred over NIOFSDir On a 64 bit env that doesn t have that much RAM MMapDir should fare no worse than NIOFSDir right Ie both are competing for the same IO cache. And so on a 64 bit JRE perhaps the default should always be MMAPDir. From my experiences MMap is always preferred if you have 64 bit system. In this case Java maps the file into address space like a swap file and often used parts are in real memory. So in my opinion it is always preferable on 64 bit systems. If you have much RAM it is even better because caching . On Linux Solaris you can see the used address space with TOP. I have a webserver with an about 7 GB big index using nmap. It is reopened very often so the used address space sometimes goes up to 50 Gigabytes but this is not a problem as it is not real memory its just like a swap file . The finalizer removes the mapped adress space fairly fast dependent on usage closing of old segements . The index in this directory is really fast especially if you have lots of real RAM that can be used for buffering. You can even load stored fields for thousands of documents very fast uninversion is also fast. Concurrency is no problem as the mapped file is handled like RAM. I always recommend users who want to use lucene Use 64 bit systems -d64 JVM parameter this enables Java in 64 bit on Solaris a lot of RAM and MMapDirectory. Wait are you saying Win 64 bit has problems w MMapDir I thought you just said Win 32 bit above . I have no lucene experience with Win64 and so I extrapolated from 32bit as I felt it was more of a Windows issue than anything else . Would be nice if someone actually tries. If it works then the rule sounds like - MMap for all 64bit systems NIO for 32bit non-win Simple for 32bit win. Is MMapDir fine w concurrency It s cool with it if you have enough memory no frequent paging occurs . I m not sure about NIOFS vs MMap on memory-constrained systems if you re competing for disk cache. Which way do you think prime all bytes up front on open should default This has a side-effect of pushing previous mmaps out of memory if you re memory-constrained. Thus under certain usage conditions frequent merging or something like that low memory this feature theoretically could be a disadvantage. For me it works well enough to be hardcoded to true If anybody s interested I can also repost an alternative for MMapD - MemoryMirroredD which wraps any given D and explicitly preloads files in non-chunked byte arrays. It s a bit faster than MMapD and MemoryD for reading but has certain disadvantages like stressing your GC and throwing OOM on merges optimize if you don t have enough heap unlike MMapD that silently swaps out . OK so I think FSDir.open should default to MMapDir on 64 bit machine NIOFSDir on non-windows machines and SimpleFSDir on windows 32 bit machines. I ll rev the patch. Next question does anyone know how to reliably determine if the running JRE is 32 or 64 bit I found this http forums.java.net jive message.jspa messageID 274406 but I m worried about how portable that solution is... Attached patch w new defaults. I plan to commit in a day or two. This issue has some more problems after committing. And there are also inconsistencies. I am working on a patch that also un-deprecates FSDir.getDirectory and removes FSDir.open again. FSDir.getDirectory will return the platform-optimal directory if no system property specifying the directory is set. Also removes some duplicate code in the FSDir.IndexInput Output by subclassing from SimpleFSDir.IndexInput but mark deprecated . My patch will remove the whole FSDir caching so getDirectory will always return a new directory and thus again LUCENE-1453 comes in my mind LUCENE-1453 currently has the problem that it only works correct with FSDir.getDirectory instances but not with self-instantiated implementations. This issue breaks some platforms if FSDirectory.open is used in some tests This is a revised patch on current trunk FSDir.open was removed the logic was included into FSDir.getDirectory and this un-deprectated If the system property is missing the same like in Mikes open happens choosing the best impl for platform Caching of FSDirs was completely removed FSDir.IndexInput Output deprected was removed suplicate code and simply replaced by deprecated subclasses of SimpleFSDir ones . This is OK for backwards compatibility. protected package-private ctors were removed getDirectory uses now reflection to find the File LockFactory ctor Some tests currently fail TestCompoundFile do not know why TestLockFactory test is obsolete execption can only occur on cached dirs Sometimes reopen does not work because already closed see LUCENE-1453 TODO Remove the caching code completely currently comented out Fix 1453 because if somebody uses a self-instantiated FSDir and not the default the reopened dir would use the default again So fix maybe clone of FSDir or LUCENE-1453 is obsolete without caching . This patch also contains an overflow fix in MMapDir for files 2 GB but large. int int should be written as long int int if the result maybe large thanks Earwin . One comment The part with the reflection and the ctor may be non-backwards compatible because if somebody overwrites the old FSDir and does not provide the wanted ctor only the default one it would fail. The default ctor would not even work as the init private internal method used by the old getDirectory is no longer available. But this is the same like in the discussion about backwards compatibility. In my opinion for 2.9 we should make FSDir abstract too. It is sooooooo seldom that somebody may create a file based dir impl nio.2 or what else Or Earwins MemoryCopiedDir . But if somebody does this he knows what he does and can fix the compilation errors easily New patch Now only TestCompoundFile fails some more imporvements. Ugh I m sorry... I had run the tests only on OS X Java 1.5 which is not 64 bit by default must specify -d64 Ð I should have tested the different OS s and JREs before committing. Thanks for jumping on this Uwe and Earwin FSDir.open was removed the logic was included into FSDir.getDirectory and this un-deprectated If the system property is missing the same like in Mikes open happens choosing the best impl for platform But the removal of the cache is not back-compatible I m not sure how whether anyone relies on that behavior . And we are wanting to move away from that global System property in choosing the class for your FSDir. This is why I switched to open instead of back to getDirectory. Caching of FSDirs was completely removed I think this must wait until 3.0 ie when we remove all getDirectory methods. FSDir.IndexInput Output deprected was removed suplicate code and simply replaced by deprecated subclasses of SimpleFSDir ones . This is OK for backwards compatibility. Excellent Caching of FSDirs was completely removed I think this must wait until 3.0 ie when we remove all getDirectory methods. I am currently playing with this. For the end-user it is not really needed that directories are cached. Even if he gets a directory that it is cached he can see it as a alone one. he can close it because of refcounting and so on and do everything he can do with a single directory too. So why is it not backwards compatible when we remove caching All tests pass here More the mixing of cached and uncached dirs bring more problems I am currently investigating . I will supply a new patch shortly with all other bugs fixed there were more e.g. with some tests in TestHelper and so on . The move from FSDir to SimpleFSDir is more complicated than it seems. In my opinion it would be a question if this move should wait until 3.0. I am currently playing with this. For the end-user it is not really needed that directories are cached. Even if he gets a directory that it is cached he can see it as a alone one. he can close it because of refcounting and so on and do everything he can do with a single directory too. The original purpose of the cache was to ensure each unique directory in the filesystem alway mapped to a single instance of FSDir so that you could synchronize on that instance and be certain that this is equivalent to synchronizing access to that underlying filesystem directory. Lucene had relied on this at one point but no longer does. I m not sure if any apps out there still rely on this so it s dangerous to simply remove it especially when we have another option using a new method open that won t break such apps. More the mixing of cached and uncached dirs bring more problems I am currently investigating . We should get to the bottom of this but these problems are pre-existing to this issue right One could already directly instantiate each directory . The move from FSDir to SimpleFSDir is more complicated than it seems. In my opinion it would be a question if this move should wait until 3.0. As long as we preserve the old getDirectory back-compatible this change should have no impact on back-compatibility. Ie it s only if you use the new FSDir.open API that you get the new behavior. I intentionally went and fixed tests to use FSDir.open so that we stress the new functionality which then led us to discover tests making invalid assumptions which we should then fix. bq The original purpose of the cache was to ensure each unique directory in the filesystem alway mapped to a single instance of FSDir so that you could synchronize on that instance and be certain that this is equivalent to synchronizing access to that underlying filesystem directory. In my opinion the cached directories vs. instantiated directories have one big advantage They are forced to use the same locking mechanism. So if somebody creates a directory using one LockFactory writes to the index and in a parallel thread uses another locking mechanism with a separate dir instance he corrupts his index. So from that point of view only have one directory instance per resource is a good thing it does not work from different JVM processes sure . Ie it s only if you use the new FSDir.open API that you get the new behavior. I intentionally went and fixed tests to use FSDir.open so that we stress the new functionality which then led us to discover tests making invalid assumptions which we should then fix. This is correct. For unit testing I found out now that it is much simplier to check if all tests would also work with other platforms if you set the FSDir system property when running the tests. With open this is currently not possible. Maybe I un-comment-out the caching again but let getDirectory still use the new behaviour if the system property is not set. We could then in 3.0 just remove the caching but let getDirectory alive. I am not sure. In my opinion this is not really a more serious bw-change than a small behaviour change that can be written into CHANGES.txt. We have more serious ones. I would strongly tend to remove the cache at all and write a warning into CHANGES.txt. At all I do not really think anybody has implemented an own subclass of FSDir. The current patch s bw-change is more that the protected no-arg ctors no longer exist and are no longer used. In my opinion the cached directories vs. instantiated directories have one big advantage They are forced to use the same locking mechanism. So if somebody creates a directory using one LockFactory writes to the index and in a parallel thread uses another locking mechanism with a separate dir instance he corrupts his index. So from that point of view only have one directory instance per resource is a good thing it does not work from different JVM processes sure . I agree. But I don t think this is a strong enough reason for Lucene to be doing such magic under-the-hood going forward. This magic leads to other problems like LUCENE-1453 . Ie it s only if you use the new FSDir.open API that you get the new behavior. I intentionally went and fixed tests to use FSDir.open so that we stress the new functionality which then led us to discover tests making invalid assumptions which we should then fix. This is correct. For unit testing I found out now that it is much simplier to check if all tests would also work with other platforms if you set the FSDir system property when running the tests. With open this is currently not possible. Excellent Before committing we should confirm all tests pass if we temporarily hardwire open to return each of the 3 FSDir impls. But I don t think this is reason enough to leave the global system property in place for real usage of Lucene. Maybe I un-comment-out the caching again but let getDirectory still use the new behaviour if the system property is not set. We could then in 3.0 just remove the caching but let getDirectory alive. I am not sure. But you ve still unnecessarily broken back-compat with that. By making a new method open which does neither the magic singleton caching nor the global system prop back-compat users are guaranteed to see no changes. In my opinion this is not really a more serious bw-change than a small behaviour change that can be written into CHANGES.txt. We have more serious ones. I would strongly tend to remove the cache at all and write a warning into CHANGES.txt. At all I do not really think anybody has implemented an own subclass of FSDir. The current patch s bw-change is more that the protected no-arg ctors no longer exist and are no longer used. Why take that chance unnecessarily What are we gaining by changing getDirectory so much in place vs switching to a new open API It s entirely possible apps have subclassed FSDir rely on the singleton cache and rely on the global system prop. Making a new API and deprecating in favor of that won t affect back-compat users at all. I am not so happy but I work on it. Currently my problem is more a failure for the test in LUCENE-1453. After reopening a DirectoryIndexReader sometimes not always the directory is closed even with the 1453-workaround. This failure depends on the random seed in testFSDirectoryReopen2 and is reproducible also with the current version of FSDirectory. It seems that 1453 is not completely fixed. I am looking now since 5 hourcs and cannot find the error the code consists of a lot of printlns and so on. When I found out what the problem is I will perhaps open an additional issue but it seems that the problem has to do with the FSDirectory changes. Somewhere the directory is closed although it should be stay open. But what I can say The error is simplier to reproduce if the directory is not cached I have a lot of other fixes for the failing tests on some platforms I will post a revised patch some time with getDirectory deprecated and open again. One thing For investigating this bug I changed the IndexReader.open methods to use a non-cached directory. I think we should do this in the final version too also for Indexwriter . So also replace FSDir.getDirectory by open for all these ctors and opens that get a String with the index directory. If we do not want to do this I suggest to deprecate all these methods and tell the user to open the directory themselfes and pass Directory instances to Writer Reader. This would help cleaning up the code immense later because we can remove all these closeDirectory checks pass-throughs everywhere which are silly... This makes the code completely not-understandable. In my opinion one should open close the directory himself and close it after usage. I am not so happy but I work on it. I am looking now since 5 hourcs and cannot find the error the code consists of a lot of printlns and so on. We can tag-team if you want Let me know if you want me to take over... This failure depends on the random seed in testFSDirectoryReopen2 and is reproducible also with the current version of FSDirectory. It seems that 1453 is not completely fixed. Yikes Ð you mean there s a pre-existing issue with the fix in LUCENE-1453 before this issue was committed I agree that code is very spooky and I ll be very happy once we remove in 3.0 the cache refCounting done by FSDir.getDirectory.... If we do not want to do this I suggest to deprecate all these methods and tell the user to open the directory themselfes and pass Directory instances to Writer Reader I like this deprecating the open methods that take File String best I have a lot of other fixes for the failing tests on some platforms I will post a revised patch some time with getDirectory deprecated and open again. OK thanks. Yikes - you mean there s a pre-existing issue with the fix in LUCENE-1453 before this issue was committed I agree that code is very spooky and I ll be very happy once we remove in 3.0 the cache refCounting done by FSDir.getDirectory.... The problem is not really the caching refcounting. The reopen code sometimes seems to close the directory even than it should not. There is no difference if the directory is cached and the number of opens is tracked by refCount or standalone. The problem is that SegmentReader s readNorms hits AlreadyClosedException then... The interesting thing is that ou can more easy reproduce it with stand-alone dirs because I removed the caching you know . The 1453 fix is also needed for stand-alone dirs so everytime codeDirectory true because if they are closed during an error whatever the same happens. It does not happen so easy with cached dirs because the old reader is normally closed after the new reopened one so during the reopen the refcount is big enough. In my opinion the only good solution is to remove the whole directory-close stuff from readers writers in 3.0 as said before. And this can be done by removing the string-type dir arguments from Reader Writer. And As these use currently FSDir.getDirectory they should be changed to FSDir.open or deprecated I tend to the last one. To conclude The error I found is only relevant if the string-type dir arguments to IndexReader are passed to FSDir.open and are separate instances without refcounting. The reopen code sometimes closes the directory although it should not which leads to problems if the directories are separate instances. With cached dirs its no problem. So if we deprecate the string directory arguments and inside that methods let FSDir.getDirectory stay alive we have no problem. In 3.0 one could then remove all this code like refcounting changing dirs and the everywhere arguments closeDirectory in SegmentReader DirectoryIndexReader MultiSegmentReader ... Then 1453 is completely solved. This patch fixes the failing tests and contains the other improvements. Previous patch missed correct ctor for SimpleFSDir for reflection. Patch looks good thanks Uwe I still see failures when I use MMapDir some tests are assuming they ll always get an FSDir . I can tackle these if you haven t already I think I forgot them when I reverted my changes. Currently I am running the tests again with MMap and after that with NIO. Oh shit on windows a very lot of tests are failing with MMap. Windows says you cannot delete or modify files which have a mapping with Solaris it works without problems e.g. TestAtomicUpdates junit C Projects lucene trunk build test 19.cfs 12.cfs Der Vorgang ist bei einer Datei mit einem gešffneten Bereich der einem Benutzer zugeordnet ist nicht anwendbar This is the problem on windows http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do bug id 4724038 The problem is that a memory mapped area is not released on close in Java it is released when GC frees it. So the problem may be that MMap can only be used for reading indexes so only read-only IndexReaders on windows. What should we do again disable MMap and only use NIOFSDir a very lot of tests are failing with MMap. It looks like all but one see below of the failures are innocent eg the test hits an exception while cleaning up removing the index directory it had created or the test is trying to overwrite a file. I agree this will be a hassle for normal usage of Lucene so let s change the default on Win64 to SimpleFSDir can t be NIOFSDir because of another Sun bug . So for open on non-Windows 32 bit we use NIOFSDir on non-Windows 64 bit we use MMapDir and on Windows 32 or 64 we use SimpleFSDir. Crazy how many challenges there are with IO on Windows from Java... This is the problem on windows http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do bug id 4724038 Sheesh that s alot of votes Can you add that bug into the toplevel javadocs of FSDir explaining why MMapDir is not a great choice on even Win64 There was one odd failure I noticed on Win64 when running tests from a mounted remote CIFS drive junit Testcase testIndexAndMerge org.apache.lucene.index.TestDoc FAILED junit junit.framework.AssertionFailedError junit at org.apache.lucene.index.FieldsWriter.addRawDocuments FieldsWriter.java 249 junit at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMerger.mergeFields SegmentMerger.java 350 junit at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMerger.merge SegmentMerger.java 139 junit at org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentMerger.merge SegmentMerger.java 116 junit at org.apache.lucene.index.TestDoc.merge TestDoc.java 182 junit at org.apache.lucene.index.TestDoc.testIndexAndMerge TestDoc.java 117 junit at org.apache.lucene.util.LuceneTestCase.runTest LuceneTestCase.java 88 I dug down and found that this test illegally opens SegmentReaders on files that IndexWriter still has open for writing and somehow this causes problems when using an MMapDir. I ll open a separate issue and put details there. I dug down and found that this test illegally opens SegmentReaders on files that IndexWriter still has open for writing and somehow this causes problems when using an MMapDir. I ll open a separate issue and put details there. This is a NIO bug in windows I assume. In Google I found a report at sun about this too. Mapped buffers from UNC-pathes have wrong bytes in their buffer. By the way the other failing tests are easy to fix Some tests check if the IndexInput throws an IOException when reading past eof. When doing this with a Byte buffer the get throws an BufferUnderflowException. It can be fixed like this in MMapIndexInputs public byte readByte throws IOException try return buffer.get catch BufferUnderflowException e throw new IOException read past eof The other failures are harmless but it would be good to fix them. I am working on that and then test extensive. The problem with not freeing the buffer can be fixed on windows using the bad hack with this sun.misc.Cleaner class and PrivilegedAction described in the bug report but this depends on Sun s internals and works only with Sun s JRE. And it may fail on some under-priviledged environments like web containers. But nevertheless with this bad hack my local version works now without any failing test on Win32 using MMap. Atached is a patch that now works at least on windows for all three versions of FSDir. One additional test was fixed to SimpleFSDir because it assumesan BufferedIndexInput . This patch contains the tweaked MMapDir that has the following features Throws correct IOExceptions on read past EOF Is able to unmap the buffer when close is called for cloned inputs nothing is done this is similar to other FSDirs . This unmapping is an illegal and unsecure hack according to Sun but I have seen other open source projects that use it. The problems with unmapping are It may fail on specific non-Sun VMs and may hit SecurityExceptions. If this happens the close call will throw an IOException. The good thing is The virtual memory usage is lower and with small indexes the 32 bit VMs do not hit OOMs if buffers are not unmapped by GC early. What do you think Should we supply this extended MMapDirectory Earwin did you try this too All tests pass now JUHU Some cleanups with initOutput remove duplicate code and unneeded methods in MMapDir. All tests pass. Will try tomorrow also on Solaris x64 with MMap. All tests pass now JUHU Excellent It may fail on specific non-Sun VMs and may hit SecurityExceptions. If this happens the close call will throw an IOException. I think we should do the hack. It seems better than nothing. But I think we shouldn t throw an exception if the hack fails Ie just fallback to relying on GC to eventually unmap What MMapDir does today . And then we can make the default on Windows 64 be MMapDir again Also can you reference this bug from FSDir s MMapDir s javadocs I m seeing this failure junit Testcase testIndexInputMethods org.apache.lucene.store.TestMMapDirectory FAILED junit FSDirectory has method public org.apache.lucene.store.IndexInput org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.openInput java.lang.String throws java.io.IOException but MMapDirectory does not override junit junit.framework.AssertionFailedError FSDirectory has method public org.apache.lucene.store.IndexInput org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.openInput java.lang.String throws java.io.IOException but MMapDirectory does not override junit at org.apache.lucene.store.TestMMapDirectory.testIndexInputMethods TestMMapDirectory.java 43 junit at org.apache.lucene.util.LuceneTestCase.runTest LuceneTestCase.java 88 I think we should fix the test to make an exception... I think we should fix the test to make an exception... I removed the test completely here but forgot to include this into the patch. The test is now invalid with the new class hierarchy of FSDir. If FSDir gets abstract in 3.0 it is clear which methods need to be overridden and so on. The intention behind the test was to check if MMap does not overwrite all FSDir Methods and because of this one of the calls could falsely return the standard FSDir impl of IndexInput. After Lucene 3.0 this is not possible as MMapDir does not extend SimpleFSDir. If we remove the test and then backwards-tag tests fail because of this we could easily fix this by adding the method simply calling super . Or remove the test in backwards-tag too. But I think we shouldn t throw an exception if the hack fails Ie just fallback to relying on GC to eventually unmap What MMapDir does today . And then we can make the default on Windows 64 be MMapDir again Also can you reference this bug from FSDir s MMapDir s javadocs Good idea. The problem is if the hack fails IndexReader may suddenly fail later on windows to delete files. Or was this only a problem in the tests. What happens if e.g. IndexWriter wants to write a new segments.gen file and so on but it is still mmapped So I preferred to throw the IOException but I can disable this easily. I would suggest to check on windows if class sun.misc.Cleaner is available and if not return SimpleFSDir. For Unix it is enough to simply ignore the cleanup throw no exception . I told you Java mmap doesn t work on Windows. And please don t use the unmap hack If it doesn t work it doesn t work. Let s for all windows versions use SimpleFSD. Look what are you going to do if you unmap a buffer and then access it by accident Crash JVM The buffer is nulled directly after unmapping. Here the patch with conditionalized MMapDirectory on windows. I am a bit nervous... We should discuss it a little bit and commit it. But everybody should test it extensive before releasing Users still using FSDir.getDirectory would not be affected so it would not break existing apps. The buffer is nulled directly after unmapping. Really Let me quote some code MacOS Java 1.6 unsafe.freeMemory address address 0 Bits.unreserveMemory capacity Does windows version differ What we see here is zeroing not nulling . When doing get set buffer never checks for address to have sense so the next access will yield a GPF The guys from Sun explained the absence of unmap in the original design - the only way of closing mapped buffer and not getting unpredictable behaviour is to introduce a synchronized isClosed check on each read write operation which kills the performance even if the sync method used is just a volatile variable. Updated patch I forgot to add a check if the IndexInput was already closed. Ah You was referring to your code. It s not thread-safe still. Someone could access the closed buffer before it sees the now-null reference to it. You also employ the hack on non-windows machines that work quite well without it. What for I know this code its on every platform the same. For our MMapDirectory this is not a problem as nobody can accidently read write the buffer because the reference to it is nulled in our code. The buffer member itsself is private so nobody can access it from outside. So after closing the IndexInput nothing can access the buffer. This is what I meant with nulling . You also employ the hack on non-windows machines that work quite well without it. What for It uses less virtual memory Ah You was referring to your code. It s not thread-safe still. Someone could access the closed buffer before it sees the now-null reference to it. For the thread-safety youre correct. To solve this we have to add the synchronized isClosed check on our side which kills performance. I wanted to check what happens if somebody really accesses the buffer after unmapping does it crash the JVM I tested on MacOS Invalid memory access of location 8b55a000 rip 0110c367 Here JVM quietly dies. non-null return code all threads are killed no diagnostic files created. It uses less virtual memory 64bit systems have an abundance of said valuable resource. Why taint them with dangerous hacks for the sake of zero returns You are right it is quite dangerous if somebody e.g. closes an IndexReader in one thread and another thread still accesses it this happens often . OK the hack now scares me Let s just return SimpleFSDir on all Windows And note this bug in the FSDir MMapDir javadocs. Also I think we should fix the open logic so that on an unknown platform not unix not windows not 64 bit return SimpleFSDir I m a bit nervous about creating MMapDirectory automatically for any OS not just Windows. Imagine a large index which is suddenly mapped to MMB w o anyone intending to do so. I think that because of the memory implications of using MMapDir we should let apps explicitly create it and not under the covers because of OS parameter. I think that using MMapDir goes far beyond just OS and hence why it s dangerous to create it under the covers. I removed the test completely here but forgot to include this into the patch. OK that makes sense. When you commit this you can also just remove the test from the back-compat branch... The hack also saves transient disk space on all systems right Just because the file name link is deleted on Unix the bytes are still consuming disk space. So Uwe in javadoc ing Sun s bug can you note that the bug causes higher transient disk usage Maybe we all should go vote for the bug... but it seems our votes will be in the noise. I ll go add this bug to http wiki.apache.org lucene-java SunJavaBugs I m a bit nervous about creating MMapDirectory automatically for any OS not just Windows. Imagine a large index which is suddenly mapped to MMB w o anyone intending to do so. This would not be a problem because MMaped files does not consume real memory. If a part of the index is seen in real memory still is in the responsibility of the operating system. I have a mmaped index here that is updated very often. It leads to a lot of assigned address space in top for the process but does not affect system performance or swapping sometimes beyond the physical limit of the machine mem swap . Memory mapping files does not consume RAM it just consumes address space this is why I changed the javadocs a little bit to clarify this . The hack also saves transient disk space on all systems right Just because the file name link is deleted on Unix the bytes are still consuming disk space. Yes this is why I let the fix enabled for any OS. Also I think we should fix the open logic so that on an unknown platform not unix not windows not 64 bit return SimpleFSDir I would not do this. NIO2 still has no solution for the problem. But they have a 64 bit buffer so you could use it instead of many buffers. On the Amsterdam ApacheCon conference this was part of the discussion with the guy from sun but I forgot what the conclusion was Maybe Oracle helps here Maybe we should move this hack to contrib a class that extends MMapDirectory by adding a close method with a big warning I m a bit nervous about creating MMapDirectory automatically for any OS not just Windows. It s almost okay for 64bit systems. The hack also saves transient disk space on all systems right That s a nice catch. Now I have some of the non-buggy-but-weird behaviour my app exhibits explained. But they have a 64 bit buffer so you could use it instead of many buffers. They don t. When NIO2 project was merged into OpenJDK they left some stuff unmerged including 64bit buffers. Currently they aren t present in OpenJDK and Java7 preview builds and not even a rough estimate is given on whether they are going to make it through and when. Maybe we should move this hack to contrib a class that extends MMapDirectory by adding a close method with a big warning I support this. The hack has some merits if carefully applied but is outright too dangerous to ship it as default. Perhaps I didn t phrase it well. I wasn t worried about memory consumption per sei but the behavior. On a couple of projects I ve worked in they were very reluctant to having packages allocate memory outside the JVM and that s my understanding of memory mapped buffers. So what worries me is that by calling FSDir.get open I will unknowingly do that ... While creating SimpleFSDir NIOFSDir has smaller effect I think this is not the case with MMapDir. But if you decide to include MMapDir in that auto-create logic I hope there will be a way to instantiate a specific FSDir in case we ll have problems with that logic. On a couple of projects I ve worked in they were very reluctant to having packages allocate memory outside the JVM and that s my understanding of memory mapped buffers. mmap does not allocate memory. It allocates address space and uses the same disk cache system already has. For example you can t cause OOM in your or another co-existing app with mmaps except eating up your own address space on 32bit systems . But if you decide to include MMapDir in that auto-create logic I hope there will be a way to instantiate a specific FSDir in case we ll have problems with that logic. Public constructors for all D variants are a must and for me they are the best that this patch has to offer I m thinking MMapDirectory is too problematic to return by default from open because of the unexpected increase transient disk usage. I think we should add the hack to MMapDir disabled by default and add a setter to enable it with javadocs clear about the warnings . When used appropriately it can make MMapdir very usable as a workaround until Sun fixes the bug. So I think we should Fix open to return NIOFSDir on all non-Windows plaforms and SimpleFSDir on Windows Document the sun bug in MMapDir FSDir Include hack in MMapDir disabled by default I am working on this because I had the same idea. I added an method setUseUnmap boolean and getter to enable this. This method throws IAE if unmap is not supported on the platform. I also reenabled the IOException on close if there was an error during unmapping. Just one additional question Should I add an additional ctor to the three classes only taking the dir name this would then be conformant to FSDir.open New patch with all suggestions updated Javadocs additional Ctors with path name only like static open method . I also corrected some deprecations and so on. MMapDirectory is no longer returned by open the logic is simple now Windows - Simple other - NIO If everybody is fine I will commit later Looks good Ð thanks Uwe Ð a few small things Can you remove the a b from the LUCENE-1658 in CHANGES.txt I think it may confuse the changes-to-html generation Can you point out that MMapDirectory will consume transient disk space regardless of platform because of this sun bug Ie this bug is not just a you can t delete the files on Windows problem it s a problem for unix as well. Maybe something like this . Due to a href http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do bug id 4724038 this bug a in Sun s JRE MMapDirectory s IndexInput.close is unable to close the underlying OS file handle. Only when GC finally collects the underlying objects which could be quite some time later will the file handle be closed. . This will consume additional transient disk usage on Windows attempts to delete or overwrite the files will result in an exception on other platforms which typically have a delete on last close semantics while such operations will succeed the bytes are still consuming space on disk. For many applications this limitation is not a problem eg if you have plenty of disk space and you don t rely on overwriting files on Windows but it s still an important limitation to be aware of. Maybe don t make MMapDir.cleanUnmapping final so subclasses could tweak it I m still nervous about throwing IOException from that method if the unmap fails but if we make it non-final then we can leave the IOException as is and users can subclass it if need be. Can you embed the try catch inside cleanMapping within s The run-on if - try is confusing now. Maybe don t make MMapDir.cleanUnmapping final so subclasses could tweak it I m still nervous about throwing IOException from that method if the unmap fails but if we make it non-final then we can leave the IOException as is and users can subclass it if need be. I reactivated this exception it was disabled before . In my opinion we should enable it to notify the user on any problems e.g. that he may must raise security privileges to enable it correctly . If the user hits an IOException he can switch off the tweak easily. By the way switching on the tweak throws IAE if the platform does not support it. cleanUnmapping is currently not really overrideable because package-private. I can unfinal it and make protected if needed I wanted to hide this dangerous method from other usages not that anyboy calls it for own ByteBuffers and crashes his JVM . I will do the other changes no problem. bq I reactivated this exception it was disabled before .

If the user hits an IOException he can switch off the tweak easily. By the way switching on the tweak throws IAE if the platform does not support it. Yeah I agree it s good to be brittle so one knows to raise security privileges. But how intermittent are the exceptions thrown from this code Is it a situation where it will always fail or always succeed In which case I agree we can leave it as it is. Attached a patch with all changes. I also reworked the exception part in the hack use the correct PrivilegedException pass-through an init the cause of the IOException so user knows if e.g. the security settings were too low . I commit shortly. hrrrrrm outdated patch. Missing was the a b in changes no fixed. Committed revision 780770 Uwe - I had code which did new FSDirectory File LockFactory however that ctor is now protected and my code does not compile. I didn t see any mentions about this in CHANGES. Since this break compat I think we should either deprecate this ctor revert it to public or document in CHANGES under the changes to back-compat policy . Right This codeyou are mentioning was not yet released So before 2.9 there was no ctor for FSDirectory that was public http lucene.apache.org java 2 4 1 api core org apache lucene store FSDirectory.html But SimpleFSDirectory can be instantiated. FSDirectory will get abstract in 3.0 and is only the base class and factory anymore. Ok. I did work against trunk so that explains. Thanks maybe we should start using since in all future issues to avoid the confusion
