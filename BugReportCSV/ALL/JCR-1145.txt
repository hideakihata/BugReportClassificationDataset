ObjectConverterImpl.getObject Session Class String may not resolve mapping correctly for incompletely described mappings
When a node is mapped by calling the ObjectConverter.getObject Session Class String method and no discriminator property is configured the ObjectConverterImpl class tries to find a best mapping for the effective node. This is done by walking the class descriptor hierarchy starting at the descriptor for the selected class until a mapping for the node type is found. In case the class descriptor hierarchy is incomplete because an improperly defined class descriptor would actually perfectly map the node but is not declared to extend or implement its parent classes interfaces the hierarchy walk down will not find the mapping and thus in the end the originally requested class will be instantiated. If the class is abstract or an interface this of course fails. If an exact class descriptor for the node type would be looked up directly the mapping might be found immediately and the class of the descriptor can be verified it actually is assignement compatible with the requested class. If this would fail we could still walk the hierarchy to see whether we find another classdescriptor. To clarify the issue consider the following example of an abstract base class and a concrete extension class with their node types    AbstractBaseClass maps abstractly to AbstractBaseType    BaseClass extends AbstractBaseClass maps to BaseType with supertype AbstractBaseType Note that the BaseClass mapping does not declare to extend the AbstractBaseClass. When calling ObjectConverterImpl.getObject session AbstractBaseClass.class aBaseTypeNode the descriptor fore the AbstractBaseClass is inspected agains the node and then it is decided to check the class descriptor hierarchy. Node mapping can be found by walking the hierarchy and hence the AbstractBaseClass is instantiated which of course fails. If the BaseClass mapping would be declared as extending the AbstractBaseClass mapping everything would be fine.Enhanced the ObjectConverterImpl.getObject Class String method as follows If a class descriptor cannot be found in the class descriptor hierarchy the actual node type is used to select a descriptor. If an alternate descriptor either by the class descriptor hierarchy or the actual node type analysis it is checked whether it is assignement compatible with the requested class. If so the alternate descriptor is used otherwise the original descriptor is used. Finally the resolved class from the class descriptor used is checked whether it is an interface or an abstract class. In any of these cases the class may not be instantiated and a JcrMappingException is thrown with an explanatory message. To test all this I added some testcases. Fixed in Rev. 579997
