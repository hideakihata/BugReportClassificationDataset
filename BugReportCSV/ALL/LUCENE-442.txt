TestIndexModifier.testIndexWithThreads is not valid 
I recently started playing with the trunk of SVN and noticed that intermitently TestIndexModifier.testIndexWithThreads revision 292010 would fail. The basic premise of the test seems to be that 3 pairs of IndexThread instances can be started in parallel each pair using the same instance of IndexModifier to concurrently and randomly add delete optimize a single FSDirectory index. The test is considered a success if the sum of additions-deletions recorded by each pair of threads equals the final docCount for the IndexModifier instance used by that pair of threads. Now I freely admit that I m not 100 familiar with the code for IndexModifier but at a glance the basic premise seems to be a If method for IndexWriter is called open it if needed close the IndexReader first if needed. b if method for IndexReader is called open it if needed close the IndexWriter first if needed. If I m understnading that correctly I see no reason to assume this test will pass. It seems like there could be plenty of scenerios in which the number of additions-deletions docCount . The most trivial example I can think of is 1 the first IndexThread instance which has a chance to run adds a document and optimizes before any other IndexThreads ever open the Directory. 2 a subsequent pair of IndexThread instances open their IndexModifier instance before any documents are deleted. 3 the IndexThread instances from 2 do nothing but add documents ...that pair of IndexThreads is now garunteed to have recorded a differnet number of additions then the docCount returned by their IndexModifier. Am I missing something or should this test be removed Hoss how exactly did the test fail what was the real number and what was the expected number I must admit I don t understand your scenario. The test happens only at the end on an optimized index. We start two threads on an empty index. Both threads randomly add and delete documents and remember the number of documents added and deleted. At the end when both threads are finished the index should contain this many documents added by thread 1 added by thread 2 - deleted by thread 1 - deleted by thread 2 This is how I understand it. Maybe you could rephrase your scenario Regards Daniel Okay I see now that there are problems with the test. I will try to fix them maybe that way it becomes clear to me if that test case makes sense at all. I see a few issues 1 A constant seed is used for reproducability private Random random new Random 101 constant seed for reproducability But it won t have that effect since the same random number generator is used across threads. 2 race condition between checking idStack.size and calling pop 3 non-atomic increment of the document id could lead to duplicates IMO the ideal multithreaded test would be designed to not use any synchronization at all making it easier to test if IndexModifier actually does all the synchronization it needs to. I just committed some updates could you please check whether it s okay now Daniel I used the following script to run through 50 iterations of the test... bin sh for i 0 i 50 i do ant test -Dtestcase TestIndexModifier mv build test TEST-org.apache.lucene.index.TestIndexModifier.xml build test TEST-org.apache.lucene.index.TestIndexModifier.xml. i done grep -l failure message build test TEST-org.apache.lucene.index.TestIndexModifier.xml. ...prior to upgrading to the changes you made 30 of the 50 test runs failed with the values being off by one or two in each case . After upgrading to TestIndexModifier.java v328151 0 of the 50 runs failed. It s not a proof of correctness but it certainly bodes well. I also want to clarify the scenerio I described earlier I m an idiot. I completely missed that each call to testIndexInternal int blocks waiting for the threads to finish Ð for some reason I thought all three calls were happening concurrently. So the types of scenerios I was initially thinking could cause problems were completely non-existent Ð and it looks like you fixed all the ones Yonik noticed. I do think Yonik has a good point however regarding a test with no synchronization at all Ð this should be possible if each instant of IndexThread maintaining it s own id and idStack variables using threadNumber - id to generate new doc identifiers and only ever deleted documents it added . Yep it looks good. I d go ahead and close this issue if I knew how... The multithreaded tests w o any synchronization is just a good general guideline. I briefly browsed the TestIndexModifier and there shouldn t be any issues in that regard since the synchronization is trivial all public methods synchronized on the same object Yonik thanks for your review. I m closing this issue now. You ll need to ask Erik to give you committer s permissions in Jira then you ll be able to close issues with the Workflow actions on the left.
