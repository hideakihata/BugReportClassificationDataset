Highlight fragment does not extend to maxDocCharsToAnalyze
The current highlighter code checks whether the total length of the text to highlight is strictly smaller than maxDocCharsToAnalyze before adding any text remaining after the last token to the fragment. This means that if maxDocCharsToAnalyse is set to exactly the length of the text and the last token of the text is the term to highlight and is followed by non-token text this non-token text will not be highlighted. For example consider the phrase this is a text with searchterm in it . In and it are not tokenized because they re stopwords. Setting maxDocCharsToAnalyze to 36 the length of the sentence and searching for searchterm gives a fragment ending in searchterm . The expected behaviour is to have in it at the end of the fragment since maxDocCharsToAnalyse explicitely states that the whole phrase should be considered. Patch changing text.length maxDocCharsToAnalyze to text.length maxDocCharsToAnalyze and adding a unit test to verify this behaviour. Thanks Lars. Nice catch - not an easy spot g Looks good to me. When I get a few free minutes I ll go over it a bit more but on first inspection certainly looks like the right fix and all tests pass.
