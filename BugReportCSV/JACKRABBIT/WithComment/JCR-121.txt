JCRTest.java First Steps example code creates a StringValue with new 
The JCRTest.java file described in the First Steps document http incubator.apache.org jackrabbit firststeps.html on the jackrabbit incubator website contains a line that attempts to create a StringValue using new rather than using the ValueFactory interface. This causes the code to fail to compile - perhaps an initiative test but could be off-putting... Simple fix is to swap the line Ên.setProperty testprop new StringValue Hello World. to n.setProperty testprop session.getValueFactory .createValue Hello World. Thanks for pointing out this issue. At the same time I also adapted the project.properties and the project.xml to use the latest version of jackrabbit. Fixed in revision 169980The website still contains the old code with the error.Fixed in revision 230778 Changes will be published when the site is generated the next time.
