HTML Text Extractor does not extract or index numerics
Numerics such as addresses dates financial figures are not extracted or indexed by the current HTML Extractor. These values are handled properly and searchable when done via the PlainTextExtractorThis issue does not occur in trunk because we are not using the text-extractors module anymore. Text extraction is now handled by Apache Tika. Fixed in 1.6 branch in revision 830478Answering some follow up questions that I got from Jeremy by email Is my understanding correct in that once upgrading to 1.6.1 the current Text-extractors module will become obsolete no 1.6.1 will be just a bug fix release without changes in module dependencies. 1.6.1 will contain a fix to the HTML text extractor. If so will any changes be required to the workspace.xml for the textFilterClasses parameter to enable the use of the Apache Tika extractors The Apache Tika based text extractor is only available in the upcoming 2.0 release but not in 1.6.x. Is it possible to enable this for JCR 1.6.0 so that HTML files have their numerics extracted and indexed It s probably easier to patch the 1.6.0 release build the jackrabbit-text-extractors on 1.6 branch or wait for the 1.6.1 release.
