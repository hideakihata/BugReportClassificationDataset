Add static readSnapshotsInfo to PersistentSnapshotDeletionPolicy
PSDP persists the snapshots information in a Directory. When you open PSDP it obtains a write lock on the snapshots dir by keeping an open IndexWriter and updates the directory when snapshots are created released. This causes problem in the following scenario Ð you have two processes one updates the content index and keeps PSDP open because it also takes snapshots . Another process wants to read the existing snapshots information and open a read-only IndexReader on the content index. The other process cannot read the existing snapshots information because p1 keeps a write lock on the snapshots directory. There are two possible solutions Have PSDP open the IndexWriter over the directory for each snapshot release. A bit expensive and unnecessary. Introduce a static readSnapshotsInfo on PSDP which accepts a Directory and returns the snapshots information. IMO it s cleaner and won t have the performance overhead of opening closing the IW as before. I ll post a patch implementing the 2nd approach shortly. I d appreciate any comments. Patch adds readSnapshotsInfo as well as a test case. Committed revision 987811 3x . Committed revision 987814 trunk . Bulk close for 3.1
