FreqProxTermsWriter leaks file handles if exceptions are thrown during flush 
FreqProxTermsWriter leaks open file handles if exceptions are thrown during flush. Code needs to be protected by try-finally clauses. Patch against 3x adds safeMaybe versions to MockIOWrapper which closes the underlying IO on exception. However TestIndexWriterExceptions.testDocumentsWriterAbort still leaves open file handles. On Windows I put a break point in several places throughout the test and even after IW.close is called I still see that .tii .tis and .frq are being kept by the Java process. Is it a bug that we don t close them in actual code not test They have no references in MockDirWrapper ... Turns out this is not a problem w MockDirWrapper and MockIOWrapper but w FreqProxTermsWriter Ð it didn t call its consumers .finish in a finally clause causing leaked file handles. The changes I ve done to MockIOWrapper cannot sustain because if I keep them then I hit an IOException from RandomAccessFile on handle is invalid which is b c I close the stream in MockIOWrapper and now FreqProx after the fix tries to close it too on the go seeking to some location and writing something. Therefore I think this is the only fix that s required for this issue the FreqProxTermsWriter . If so I will also rename it and add a CHANGES entry. Looks great Shai Nice catch Thanks for tracking this one down Shai After fixing this is it then possible to fail lucene tests if we cannot delete the directory or are there still issues with special tests I think that it will be good to fail the test if we fail to delete directories. Only problem is that on Linux it won t fail which means we won t see build failures. I wonder if MockDirWrapper can catch that for us though ... if noDeleteOpenFile openFiles.size 0 print the first one as its very verbose otherwise Exception cause null Iterator Exception stacktraces openFileHandles.values .iterator if stacktraces.hasNext When I debug-traced the failures I noticed that I never went inside the if even though noDeleteOpenFile was true. I m pretty sure that openFileHandles is not empty b c only MockIO IIWrappers removes themselves from it. We should at least be able to report those handles that were open but never closed. I will commit this fix to 3x. I saw same file exists in trunk so I ll fix it there too and try to catch any other failures. Changed issue title and description. I see that MockDirWrapper.createOutput does not add the IndexOutput to openFiles only to openFileHandles while openInput adds the IndexInput to both. Then MockIndexInput removes itself from the Map. Is it a bug As a side note and maybe a separate issue I think we should improve the way MockII IO interact w MockDirWrapper. Currently they access the maps directly and I prefer them to be accessed via methods. That way we can better track what s going on on failures. Resolving this issue. We can track the MockDir stuff separately. Committed revision 1127614 3x . Committed revision 1127615 trunk . Thanks Mike and Robert for the review Bulk closing for 3.2
