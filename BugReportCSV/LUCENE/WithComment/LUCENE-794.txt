Extend contrib Highlighter to properly support PhraseQuery SpanQuery ConstantScoreRangeQuery
This patch adds a new Scorer class SpanQueryScorer to the Highlighter package that scores just like QueryScorer but scores a 0 for Terms that did not cause the Query hit. This gives actual hit highlighting for the range of SpanQuerys PhraseQuery and ConstantScoreRangeQuery. New Query types are easy to add. There is also a new Fragmenter that attempts to fragment without breaking up Spans. See http issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-403 for some background. There is a dependency on MemoryIndex. There are two highlighting modes highlight entire spans or highlight first and last word of each span. For the highlight first and last word of span it would probably be better to change QuerySpansExtractor.getSpansFromPhraseQuery so that it creates a series of near spans instead of a single near span with multiple clauses. Looks like a good start Mark - thanks for contributing this I ve had a quick play and have identified the following issues 1 Fieldname contents shouldn t be hardcoded into the Highlighter - different analyzers can behave differently for different fields see PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper . Either pass a fieldname parameter or do as the existing highlighter does and take a TokenStream. The latter approach has the advantage of being able to avoid re-analysis and make use of any stored TermVectors see TokenSources.java 2 Analyzers which produce overlapping tokens see Synonym analyzer in existing highlighter Junit test are problematic in the existing code. I remember the TokenGroup class in the existing highlighter was an approach to help cater for these overlap scenarios. 3 Without wishing to resurrect the whole 1.4 vs 1.5 debate I beleive Lucene still targets Java 1.4. To rectify these points it s not clear to me if it would be quicker to use your code or adapt the existing highlighter code to use spans. Thoughts Thanks again Mark Sorry about all that Mark H. This was literally just some test code that I quickly shoved into an api similar to your existing highlighter. If you decided that it should be something considered on it s own I would certainly have quite a bit further to go. Mostly I just put it up for your evaluation on extending the current highlighter with this highlight method. 1 Fieldname contents shouldn t be hardcoded into the Highlighter - different analyzers can behave differently for different fields see PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper . Either pass a fieldname parameter or do as the existing highlighter does and take a TokenStream. The latter approach has the advantage of being able to avoid re-analysis and make use of any stored TermVectors see TokenSources.java I don t have a great solution for this right now. I need to read the TokenStream at least twice due to the MemoryIndex extracting the spans. Unfortunately it seems I can copy the tokens to a list or pass them to the MemoryIndex – I cannot do both. The MemoryIndex is also looking for a field name...so while I changed the api to take a TokenStream I have not resolved also needing the field name. I am hoping you have some good comments. To get around reading the TokenStream twice I used the horribly hackey but quick-for-me method of adding a method to MemoryIndex that accepts a List of Tokens. Any ideas 2 Analyzers which produce overlapping tokens see Synonym analyzer in existing highlighter Junit test are problematic in the existing code. I remember the TokenGroup class in the existing highlighter was an approach to help cater for these overlap scenarios. I always attack this last G . Seems a simple fix if position increment equals 0 skip printing out the token. It passes your test which I have added to my test code but I am not totally confident it is perfect yet. 3 Without wishing to resurrect the whole 1.4 vs 1.5 debate I beleive Lucene still targets Java 1.4. Just me being lazy. I swear I have seen Contrib stuff that says 1.5. I have gone through and stripped out all of the 1.4 except for StringBuilder for the moment. To rectify these points it s not clear to me if it would be quicker to use your code or adapt the existing highlighter code to use spans. Thoughts Depends entirely on what you think. I am sure I can fix all of the issues you mention with a little advice G but I am pretty new to this type of thing and perhaps you just want to start from scratch in order to achieve span highlighting with the existing highlighter. It may just be that the way I am doing this is not very compatible with the way you currently fragment and score. I have added an updated Highlighter.java and HighlighterTest.java. The MemoryIndex problem remains...so it either has to be fixed or the modified MemoryIndex must be used. Mark m There is indeed some Java 1.5 code in contrib I believe the gdata-server uses 1.5 classes. I think that s okay for contrib. Sorry about all that Mark H No need for any apologies - all help is gratefully received I don t mean to criticise your efforts or seem picky - I just wanted to record my findings somewhere useful if we were to consider working a solution up from this test code rather than tweaking the current highlighter - I m still uncertain about the best approach. I also thought it might be useful to point the potential issues out to you if you were already reliant on using this code somewhere. I need to read the TokenStream at least twice I used the horribly hackey but quick-for-me method of adding a method to MemoryIndex that accepts a List of Tokens. Any ideas I m not sure about modifying MemoryIndex. It should be easy enough to create a subclass of TokenStream - CachedTokenStream perhaps which takes a real TokenStream in it s constructor and delegates all next calls to it and also records them in a List for the the first use. This can then be rewound and re-used to run through the same set of tokens held in the list from the first run. if position increment equals 0 skip printing out the token...but I am not totally confident it is perfect yet. I think it s possible some of the more Byzantine analyzers may have a position increment 0 but overlap in terms of their byte offsets. I d need to check the old Junit tests to be sure on this. Welcome to my hell Thanks again for your help. Mark H Removed 1.5 dependencies fixed api I switched to accepting an analyzer and a field name. I need the field name anyway for the MemoryIndex. I agree that modifying MemoryIndex was horrible and I have removed that dependency just did it as a quickfix . I used the CachedTokenStream anyway to avoid analyzing twice once for MemoryIndex and again for Highlighter use. Thanks for the idea...shows how bright I am having missed it g . I removed all of the 1.5 code. The code is probably fairly usable right now then. I think synonyms work fine unless a case does exist like you suggested. So I suppose we have 4 options 1. I extend and polish the code needs more test cases most of mine where written using my query parser and it is used independently for full document highlighting based on spans. I would like to add google cache like coloring 2. The code is either merged with the existing highlighter or gutted to create a single highlighter that can fragment based on spans or based on the original term based approach. 3. The code is ignored and someone else starts fresh adding span support to the existing highlighter. 4. The code languishes in purgatory and we await the unknown. Mark M Updated code to address deficiency in highlighting BooleanQueries. Use the following latest classes CachedTokenStream DefaultEncoder Encoder Formatter Highlighter QuerySpansExtractor SimpleFormatter HighlighterTest Using an Analyzer that produces multiple tokens at the same position does not yet operate correctly if used at query time. Using such a synonym analyzer for indexing and a non synonym analyzer for searching will work fine. I had some free time today and came back this issue. I was so set on my own needs to start on this that I completely ignored looking closely at the contrib highlighter code. I went back and read over it this morning and am in the middle of a new solution. The new solution is in the form of new SpanQueryScorer that extends Scorer and plugs into the original contrib highlighter code. I have adapted almost all of the original tests still a few to go and so far they all still pass using the SpanQueryScorer. There is no guarantee yet that Spans will not be chopped up but I am sure there is a way to share Span info with a Fragmenter if you wanted to rectify this I may get to it . I also have not implemented a scoring properly yet...at the moment any term that is found returns a score of 1 and each unique term in a fragment contributes 1 to the fragment score. I will look at going further here but I will be posting the code first after I convert the rest of the relevant tests and add a few Span Query tests. I am pretty confident this will be a great solution for actual hit highlighting with the already tried and true contrib Highlighter fragments and all. -Mark I am pretty confident this will be a great solution Great stuff Mark. Sorry I ve been out of the loop on this recently and not participating as much as I d like - just too tied up with other work. I look forward to seeing your work Cheers Mark H Howdy Mark H I have not got into making new SpanQuery tests yet but at this point I could use some help guidance. All of the original highlighter tests are passing with the new SpanScorer except for two 1. testFieldSpecificHighlighting This will not pass the second assertion ignore fields because when i add the TokenStream to a MemoryIndex I have to add it to a field. I am stumped on getting around this one. 2. testOverlapAnalyzer2 Passes the first bunch but then fails on one. This is because I am looking up terms based on position since the Spans do not return the term text. The first assertion failing is looking for hi- b speed b but finds b hi-speed b because both speed and hi-speed are at position 0...consequently both score a 1. Any thoughts I was thinking about gathering all possible terms in the SpanQueryExtractor and someone using them... Beyond that I am sure you can find plenty of other things to point out . Have at me g Any ideas on scoring would be appreciated as well. Feel free to run with this on your own if you have time as well...or run with it a bit and pass it back or just provide some guidance as I go...whatever works out best for you. Mark M By the way...I apologize the file list is so messy now. You just need SpanScorer SpanQueryExtractor CachedTokenStream SpanHighlighterTest and there is the dependency on MemoryIndex Almost at the holy grail here. Everything works except the optional ignoring fields in the Query object. Scores work all other tests pass and even better there is no more limitation of only highlighting the first and last term in a Span – instead all correct terms in each Span will be highlighted. The only change to the existing code I had to make was to add a parameter to scoreToken Token token – I had to add int position. I still think it is very feasible to pass info from this SpanScorer to a Fragmenter so that the Freagmenter can attempt to avoid splitting up Spans. The current code will correctly highlight pretty much any standard or span query I think g based on actual hits using the exisiting contrib highlighter code...I have yet to write out the new extensive Span tests and I would appreciate it if some others would go over the code for some obvious improvements but this is almost ready. Get the latests SpanScorer SpanQueryExtractor CachedTokenStream SpanHighlighterTest WeightedSpanTerm Highlighter Mark Mark I ll take a look at this any year now. I think the code can be used or tweaked to act as term order suggestion and untokenized cosmetic suggestion from stored values in my didyoumean-patch. Is there some documentation that describes this patch in a chronologically ordered text rather than just the java docs Some simple package level html would probably help me to get started. I have a patch coming tonight. It fixes a few odd mistakes and has a little more documentation. I had wanted to subpackage it into spanscorer for now but it appears I can t make a patch with a new folder so that is out. Should I merge my package.html documentation with the one currently in highlighter Also I am not sure how a contrib that depends on another contrib should work build file wise SpanScorer depends on MemoryIndex . I just made up something that works for now. This new patch will be off the trunk so now the RangeQuery test fails as it does with the original QueryScorer...you cannot highlight a constantrangequery to my knowledge. You also cannot ignore the fields in the query as you can with QueryScorer so that test fails. The only way that I can see doing this is to have the option in your query parser of ignoring all fields and just using one field name during parsing. Send the field-normal Query to search and then make a field-neutered query for highlighting. That is the approach I will be taking with my query parser. I sure wish there was something better though. Ill post the patch when I get out of work. Mark Forget all the .java files...just get spanhighlighter.patch and apply to the trunk. Still looking for pointers on how to handle to build.xml Hi Mark I found a little time to look at the span Highlighter the other night and was struggling with some missing bits and pieces updated Scorer missing SynonymAnalyzer etc so only got as far as getting it all to compile before I ran out of time. Hopefully the patch will make life easier - will investigate when I have another chance. As for the build.xml - have a look at XMLQueryParser s build.xml in contrib. This has a dependency on the queries contrib module added to the build.xml. Cheers Mark H Yeah the patch should take care of all of that...I would have started with a patch but this was literally my first and it took me a bit to figure it all out especially with eclipses subclipse plugin using absolute paths instead of relative in the patch..then I was trying forever to add a new package before finding out I can t add a folder to a patch...but now that I got it all worked out it should make life much easier for anyone trying this g I will use patches from now on. Thanks for the build.xml info and for taking a look. Patch version 2 Changed to correct build.xml removed some unneeded code Has been working well for me personally could still use some additional span highlighting tests This patch tries another approach instead of changing the existing Highlighter api. The result is that if you call getBestFragments more than once you must call reset on the SpanScorer between each call. Whether this is better than modifying the existing api I am not sure. This patch also adds a new SimpleSpanFragmenter that fragments based on size but ensures that Spans are not broken up. This class might not be perfect yet. I have finally come up with a way to ignore fields and so the final test testFieldSpecificHighlighting passes for this. Now all original Highlighter tests pass with this patch. Pass null as the field to SpanScorer and fields will be ignored during highlighting. SpanScorer now has the same behavior as the QueryScorer except that actual hits are highlighted. I have also made a small fix to the SimpleSpanFragmenter. I am still not sure if it is better to change the Highlighter API or require the kind of nasty call to reset the SpanScorer between calls to getBestFragments. I have used a zip file this time. It contains the patch plus an index folder that holds a new class called TermModifier. This was necessary because I cannot add folders to the patch but TermModifier needs to be in the org.apache.lucene.index package. First apply then patch then add the index folder to the correct place in the Highlighter contrib section. Not a lot left to do here. What do you think Mark H Mark Hi Mark Got the code patched and running here. Junit seems to work fine but I feel a little uncomfortable about use of the TermModifier class. Using this has the potentially undesirable side-effect of changing the client s query field. If they plan on re-running the same query this could be a problem. I ll need to have a think if there is a better solution to this. Cheers Mark Hey Mark I wasn t too happy about TermModifier either since I am basically violating encapsulation...TermModifier basically makes field public. I really don t see how it is possible to ignore fields in another way though. If you can think of a way that would be awesome . At a minimum the Term fields could be set back to their original value after doing the Span search...I wouldn t think that would be much of a performance hit. Mark At a minimum the Term fields could be set back to their original value after doing the Span search.. Hmm. If the query is being reused in a multi-threaded server environment this wouldn t fly. I really don t see how it is possible to ignore fields in another way though I can think of one. Your current approach is based on modifying the query to suit the MemoryIndex content. Another approach may be to modify the MemoryIndex content to suit the query. Your code creates a MemoryIndex when presented with the text of a field. If it recognised it was being used in field-insensitive mode it could extract the query terms and create a MemoryIndex field for each unique fieldname in the set of query terms - using the same source text a CachedTokenStreamAnalyzer could be used to avoid excessive tokenization of this text This approach would of course use some more memory but avoids the unpleasantness of changing Query objects contents. I haven t fully considered the implications of this idea yet - initial thoughts Cheers Mark Another approach may be to modify the MemoryIndex content to suit the query. Your code creates a MemoryIndex when presented with the text of a field. If it recognised it was being used in field-insensitive mode it could extract the query terms and create a MemoryIndex field for each unique fieldname in the set of query terms This should work fine. I had dismissed it and again butted heads with it for a while now that you mentioned it because I couldn t see the forest through the trees. I kept thinking this is just not going to work with a Span query that has terms from different fields. Over and over I thought that. How can I ignore fields in a SpanQuery. Now it hits me rather embarrassingly such a SpanQuery doesn t make sense at all. I will try your approach and submit a new patch. Mark How can I ignore fields in a SpanQuery. Now it hits me rather embarrassingly such a SpanQuery doesn t make sense at all. Just to make sure we re talking about the same thing. Yes I too came to the obvious realisation that a single SpanQuery cannot test content from more than one field - but I don t think that is something we were trying to support here. The requirement as I understand it is to support a scenario where a SpanQuery was testing only one field say the body field and yet the user wanted to see any matches that just so happened to occur in another field say the title field. Nowhere in the query was there a suggestion of any criteria mandatory or otherwise testing the title field - the user just wanted to highlight the title field for additional decoration. In this scenario we have the challenge of taking the body query terms and using them to highlight title field content. A match would have to disregard the original choice of field name but would still require that the positions of term text adhered to the SpanQuery logic. Hope this makes sense Mark Yup we are on the same page. I was just buried in the code at the time and having stared at your code that ignores the field for each Term I was not thinking from a high level but was instead stuck on the process of ignoring fields in a similar manner. For whatever reason it never dawned on me that we don t have to worry about a Span that has Terms with different field values. After staring at your suggestion long enough my brain de-fogged. I will submit an updated patch tomorrow. Mark Just for thought what about a SpanOr query with two sub Span queries that target different fields Too obscure to care about I will post the new patch later tonight. Mark Bah that last comment is rubbish again. Of course that will work alright. Everything is looking sharp. On another note though what do you think about the restriction of having to reset the SpanScorer between calls to getBestFragments Is this preferable to an api change Mark Apologize for the delay on this – I was pulled into a busy product launch. This adds the final piece replacing TermModifer with multiple Memory Indexes. I also did a little refactoring especially in the SpansExtractor. All tests now pass and I have been using this succesfully for some time now. For anyone new following this issue ignore all of the files except for this one spanhighlighter5.patch Mark I was able to apply the spanhighlighter5.patch. I m inexperienced with ant and svn so I assume the slight troubles I had were self-inflicted I mention them in case they are of any help. I might have missed something but my MemoryIndex.java seemed to be missing the implementation of the abstract isPayloadAvailable method from TermPositions. That was causing my build to fail so I added the method simply returning false. After that change the tests run and life was good again. I do get a failed test at org.apache.lucene.search.highlight.HighlighterTest.testGetRangeFragments HighlighterTest.java 137 but it looks like that might be expected. The search is kannedy TO kznnedy . I am now looking into getting the total number of hits for a given query for un-normalized scoring and the hit positions saved for larger scale analysis and browsing . I have code that does this but hope I can improve on my existing approach by using this highlighting patch. Thanks Sean Sorry Sean I forgot to mention that the patch is off of the latest Lucene trunk code. The range query test should fail because they switched the query parser to return a constant score query instead of a range query. Cannot highlight a constant score query. Mark Thanks Mark. I had the trunk from a few days ago perhaps a week so that was just me being lazy - . Is there anything I should be aware of the parser.setUseOldRangeQuery true in doSearching String queryString about  line 890 in SpanHighlighterTest.java I ve read the javadocs which explain it a bit but I don t think a understand enough to infer why you use it in the SpanHighterTest.java. If I can relatively safely ignore that I will.

I think the functionality exists in your patch or could be easily extended. I just can t seem to get my head around where to start. Thanks Sean Updated the patch to version 6. Apply against Lucene trunk. Updated CachedTokenStream to implement reset instead of rewind Removed rewind checks in CachedTokenStream Reordered QuerySpansExtractor constructors and added one QuerySpansExtractor now interns field name for faster comparisons against Token fields Hi Mark I don t know the details of your patch. I just saw your class CachedTokenStream and was wondering if you re aware of the new class CachingTokenFilter in the analysis package Maybe you could use that Thanks Michael – I was not aware and will certainly make the change in the next patch I put up. Minor update to straighten a few things out. Replaced custom CachingTokenStream with Lucene s CachingTokenFilter Some refactoring in the SpanExtractor now WeightedSpanTermExtractor Updated some stale JavaDoc I plan on one more release and than I am finished. I need to optimize the scoring stop looking at positions for terms that are not position sensitive Make a couple unit tests to check for a bug I suspect Turn the javadoc s into something I am actually proud of. I would wait for this final patch before taking a look at this Mark H. I apologize for being so incremental on this issue...lesson learned. Mark patch version 8 Apply to root dir of trunk Fixed a bug that was caused when a query had the same term multiple times Added a unit test for the bug just mentioned Improved performance by not converting Querys that are not position sensitive to SpanQuerys. Non position sensitive Query clauses are treated the same way the standard Scorer would treat them. Some refactoring based on the previous change. Improved some of the JavaDoc comments patch version 9 Apply to root dir of trunk Various small improvements. Be sure to use the recently updated CachingTokenFilter for optimal performance. Mark wow long list of files up there. I can t tell which ones are still relevant. Ah only spanhighlighter9.patch right It looks like all files in that patch are new files that is this is a parallel highlighter implementation - we can leave the old one in there and commit yours without worrying about breaking the old one. Could you add Apache license headers to all files switch to 2 spaces for indentation and then I think this can get committed Oh and since contrib can be java 1.5 I think you can use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer etc. Requested changes have been made. Only relevant file now is spanhighlighter10.patch. This is a parallel implementation...it uses all of the current Highlighter classes. Really it is just a new Scorer implementation that scores position sensitive queries based on correct positions for a hit. The whole approach was radically changed from the StringBuilder version so all code is still Java 1.4 compatible. I have been using this extensively with great success for a few months now. I gave this patch a whirl and it looks great. I do see one problem. Say a document contains x y z a b y z and the query is x y z the highlighter will return with terms in brackets denoting highlighted terms x y z a b y z Since the last y and z are not part of the full phrase they should not be highlighted. I believe the issue is that turning a PhraseQuery into a representative Span query is only an approximate conversion. I will look into whether or not I can improve this. Thanks for the feedback. Mark I made up a quick test to identify the behavior but did not duplicate your results The results of your example doc in index x y z a b y z Searching for x y z Result b x b b y b b z b a b y z Could you post some code demonstrating the problem Hmm I tried it again and now it s working correctly. Maybe I had interpreted the output incorrectly. Sorry for the false alarm. Ah I wasn t crazy. I had the test data wrong. Here s the code I m using to produce the failing result String text y z x y z a b Analyzer analyzer new StandardAnalyzer QueryParser parser new QueryParser body analyzer Query query parser.parse x y z CachingTokenFilter tokenStream new CachingTokenFilter analyzer.tokenStream body new StringReader text Highlighter highlighter new Highlighter new SpanScorer query body tokenStream highlighter.setTextFragmenter new NullFragmenter tokenStream.reset String result highlighter.getBestFragments tokenStream text 1 ... System.out.println result This produces B y B B z B B x B B y B B z B a b The beginning y and z shouldn t be highlighted. If I change the the beginning y and z to x and y I get the correct result x y x y z a b x y B x B B y B B z B a b Here s a couple other failing results z x y z a b B z B B x B B y B B z B a b z a x y z a b B z B a B x B B y B B z B a b FYI I m using the latest version of Lucene. Thanks a lot Andy. As I suspected the issue is that the conversion from PhraseQuery to SpanQuery is inexact. I have updated the code to handle this case though. If a PhraseQuery has 0 slop then the created Span query will now force an inorder match. This should be a nice improvement to the PhraseQuery to SpanQuery approximation. Patch with fix and new junit test attached. patch 11 Mark Nice little addition courtesy of Michael Goddard ...In our Lucene work we took the approach of indexing all fields into a single field FULLTEXT which is the default field for queries. Our query syntax is such that a user can combine clauses against named fields with clauses with no field specified. When we go to highlight such queries if a given clause is against this FULLTEXT field but we re highlighting text in the TITLE field we d still like for matching terms to be highlighted... Thanks for the patch Micahael. There is a new constructor that allows you to specify a default field. Terms from this field will be highlighted regardless of the specific field you are highlighting. Only file to worry about in that huge mess of files listed above is spanhighlighter12.patch. Anything anyone wants to see to further this issue It seems like a no brainer to add to the current contrib Highlighter...at this point more than a few people are using it. Suggestions criticisms interest Mark I did a little bit more with this since I needed support for highlighting queries containing ConstantScoreRangeQuery s. Would you be interested in looking at those changes Makes sense to commit it to me. I want to spend some time reviewing this in more detail once I m through with contributing the new web-based version of Luke. At a quick glance does the new Junit test in this patch encompass both old and new Highlighter tests In which case should we remove the old Junit test if they overlap Michael I would love to take a look. I ve got the code you sent me and I will go through it soon. Mark That is an issue that should probably be cleaned up. A lot of tests are shared the new SpanScorer just requires some different odd setup that made it easier to copy and change the test file. I will spend some time trying to combine them into one test file to avoid the overlap. I re-skimmed this JIRA issue just now. Other than the final cleanup that Marks mention any reason this is not yet in svn How should this relate to LUCENE-663 Seems like that one also covers other kinds of queries I m no expert in highlighting but it seems like there is at least 3 different issues in JIRA for enabling things like phrase queries etc. Should we try to consolidate these Never mind I went back and read the thread at http lucene.markmail.org message p4gfxewk6jcqfxxj q highlighter list org 2Eapache 2Elucene 2Ejava-user which I think accounts for this approach and makes sense to me. Mark I ve still got a little work to do on it but would like to also include support for highlighting of RangeQuery within SpanNearQuery. I have a new SpanQuery subclass which helps and will post that to see if it merits inclusion within Lucene. In conjunction with that I d have one last else if clause to add to the patch covered by this issue. Basically I m trying to make a case for the work covered in this Jira issue being committed since it s very useful to me. Hows that work coming Michael I have started turning the two test classes into one and I d like to get together one final patch with your new work when I am done. I have checked out your code that adds ConstantScoreRangQuery support and it looks great. Great idea there. Mark Thanks for looking at that. I just entered a new Jira issue for the new work https issues.apache.org jira browse LUCENE-1148 which seems to work well enough with the most recent spanhighlighter patch code since it already contains a clause to handle SpanQuery. So no need to wait on anything from me. Mike Relocated the fir.close to after the extract bq terms call. Problem had manifested itself as a org.apache.lucene.store.AlreadyClosedException but should be fixed via this patch. This patch gets rid of the separate SpanScorer test class and combines all test in HighlighterTest. Almost all of the tests are now run twice - once with the standard QueryScorer and once with the new SpanScorer. Thanks to all for the bug fixes and contributions. Mark Mark I added a few lines of code to the WeightedSpanTermExtractor.extract method to handle DisjunctionMaxQuery instances. I didn t take the time to make a patch against your new version but the code is pretty simple ... else if query instanceof DisjunctionMaxQuery Map disjunctTerms new HashMap for Iterator iterator DisjunctionMaxQuery query .iterator iterator.hasNext extract Query iterator.next disjunctTerms terms.putAll disjunctTerms else ... Thanks looks great. New patch with posted code. Hey Mark H any chance you will have some time to look at this soon Now that the test classes have been merged any change to the current contrib test class will break this patch. I think everything is good except that we might want to alert which Highlighter version caused the Junit test to fail. since almost every test is run with both the standard and new Span Highlighter. I may just be nitpicking there though. Will do. I m taking a quick look now but should have more time tomorrow. Thanks Mark Couple of quick comments from a first look. I amended the new unit test stripped out all new Span related tests and compared running it against 2.3 highlighter code and this patch. On this rough test it looks like the new implementation is slightly faster executing these tests 2.6 seconds vs 3.0 . Good stuff. The general advice on using the Highlighter is to call it with re-written queries in order to highlight fuzzy queries etc. That being the case the support for ConstantScoreRangeQuery in WeightedSpanTermExtractor is not likely to work because ConstantScoreRangeQuery rewrites to a ConstantScoreQuery and therefore can t be inspected for terms. Hope to spend some more time looking at this tomorrow. Good catch right off Mark. Appreciate you looking into this so quickly g You ve got a darn quick eye for problems. Hey Michael G. How are you dealing with the rewrite issue for the ConstantScoreRangeQuery I assume you just are not using rewrite Any comments on this Actually is it worth trying to resolve this ConstantScoreRangeQuery issue 1 A large range can produce a lot of terms - extracting these would bloat memory and slow down highlighting. 2 The sorts of quantity fields that are subject to ranges prices dates lat-lon coordinates don t typically need highlighting anyway because a range criteria is normally mandatory so ALL results are expected to match the range and highlighting matches is unnecessary b Quantities are normally held in dedicated fields with only one value. Unlike free-text fields there s no need for the user s eye to scan large amounts of information looking for the hit so again highlighting summarising is generally less useful. Given the unavoidable performance overhead this introduces and the sneaking suspicion that it s not useful anyway is this worth supporting Would be keen to know what the scenario was that introduced this as a requirement. This may be largely irrelevant but Solr has a ConstantScorePrefixQuery which has similar issues but should be highlighted most of the time . It might find its way into lucene core one day. I m fairly certain that Mark H. s comments are correct but somehow I was getting highlighting. ConstantScoreRangeQuery was the query I d used initially but I had to later introduce a SpanRangeQuery which I could embed in SpanNearQuery instances. And yes we have users who need this perverse combination. They have a query syntax which is very expressive and enables them to nest proximity SpanNearQuery queries to an arbitrary depth they can even embed numeric range queries within any of these sub-queries. The requirement is mainly cultural arising out of the long time use of a pure boolean text engine. Still over the past fifteen or so years the user base has developed a fairly large body of literature – queries they use to find certain things – and they don t want to throw all of that away. I agree that this type of thing is sort of specialized but I thought there might just be a few others out there with similar needs. The need to highlight all of this is due to the fact that several tools are use to post-process search results and visualize them. I really appreciate the attention you guys have given to this. There s the background from my end. Thanks. Thanks Michael Seems we can drop it to me then. I don t know that the performance would be that bad - you are only extracting the terms from an index with a single document so there is not likely to be that many terms. but Initially I thought that highlighting something like the Date would be nice as it would visually indicate that piece s involvement in selecting the document...but as Mark points out its really not that helpful at all. Since Micahel doesn t even need it anymore it seems we prob shouldn t even keep it as configurable. Just drop it then Mark This may be largely irrelevant but Solr has a ConstantScorePrefixQuery which has similar issues No very relevant. Only yesterday I had a user with exactly the same highlighting problem it seems we prob shouldn t even keep it as configurable. Just drop it then My nightmare scenario is systems where people are using ConstantScoreRangeQuery in their queries to do both latitude and longitude ranges over large areas - that s a lot of terms. I d at least want the option of NOT loading them all into RAM at once when highlighting. Maybe we could look at having different highlight matchers . The existing approach of keeping a big bag of query terms becomes a TermsMatcher simply looks up tokens in a HashSet of terms You can imagine a new PrefixMatcher which would examine tokens using startsWith and a RangeMatcher examine tokens using just a start and end term. However there s a danger we could end up re-implementing a lot of query logic so maybe the relevant queries filters could implement a Matcher interface to enable the same logic that is used when scanning TermEnum at query time to be used by the Highlighter when looking at TokenStreams i e. something like this interface Matcher boolean matches String value Needs some more thought yet but it could be an approach. One way to solve the problem of many terms in a range or a prefix query is by indexing terms in a hierarchy of prefixes for example for a date CCYYMMDD can be indexed as all of C CC CCY CCYY CCYYMM CCYYMMD and CCYYMMDD on the same position. Then for a range and prefix queries the query analyzer can construct an OR over as few terms as possible. Query search and highlighting would work faster and still correct as they are based on the term positions. This is a patch that applies on top of SpanHighlighter-01-28-2008.patch in order to highlight MutliPhraseQueries Another attempt at putting this to bed. Added the MultiPhraseQuery support patch above - thanks Updated some code to stop using deprecated methods. Made highlighting ConstantScoreRangeQuerys optional defaulting to false. Mark Hey is this 14-month old impressive persistence MM piece of work ready to be committed Just tried the latest of everything- patch applies cleanly Junit test passes and I ve just run my own additional side-by-side tests with my content to see the effects of new phrase support and without. Looks good to me - unless there are any objections I ll go ahead and commit. Hi probably I m missing something I m not sure this is the right place to ask my question but I can t understand how patch mechanism works. First I downloaded source code from http svn.apache.org repos asf lucene java trunk contrib highlighter then I tried to apply every patches listed above. I wrote a trivial bash script for apply patches I m assuming that these one are not cumulative patch but unsuccessfully. thanks in advance...

Steven thanks a lot now it s working Brian looking for lucene-memory-x.x.x.jar Ah got it. You have to ant dist before applying the patch to build the memory jar then apply the patch and ant again. Committed as part of r652164. Thanks for all your hard work and putting up with my limited availability support Mark. I owe you a beer.. Committed as part of r652164. I must be missing something but after your commit I did a clean checkout of lucene trunk did an ant dist and am getting the same MemoryIndex problem as I reported above. Before I could just apply the patch after doing the ant dist first but now that the patch is in trunk I can t get around that. How are you compiling lucene now from trunk You have to ant dist before applying the patch to build the memory jar then apply the patch and ant again. this seems like a bug inconsistency in the new contrib highlighter build.xml it added a buildHighlighter target which takes care of the dependency in building contrib memory ... this isn t the way this is normally handled in contrib build.xml files because it s a non standard target name that people and the contrib walking code don t know about. xml-query-parser has a better example of doing this same kind of dependency... target name compile-core depends build-queries common.compile-core Darn...waited just too long to comment on this. I had noticed two tiny things there is a System.out if a query is not recognized by the Query to Span converter. Also the get weightedTerms call might want to accept a cachingtokenfilter rather than a tokenstream...I don t think this is a biggie though...just avoids double wrapping in a cachingtokenfilter if that is what is passed in. Someone mentioned that one on the list a few days ago. Neither issues are a big deal but would be nice to get the System.out out of there...sorry I missed it in the patch. Also Sorry about the bad build file Hoss I swear I copied it off another contrib I didn t know how to do it frankly so I can t explain why its so incorrect. Maybe I have accumulated too much of this beer I keep demanding and dont remember changing things for the worse... Here is a kill on the System.out. I should make a new issue right Probably no need for a new issue just commit the fix. But I also noticed that CHANGES.txt has no mention of LUCENE-794. Somebody forgot to mention the fix there It s not too late Regarding issues with building this I am seeing the same thing both for contrib highlighter and contrib xml-query-parser. Running ant compile-core from within those dirs does not work and running ant build-contrib also fails. The problem in both is with the dependency on contrib memory and contrib queries. Here is what fixes xml-query-parser Instead of ..... inheritall false Use this ......inheritall true dir .. queries And a similar thing for contrib highlighter. I ll commit both fixes shortly. Hi I m new to Lucene and the highlighter so I apologize if my question is obvious. In any case I m trying to allow phrase highlighting in my instance of Lucene so I applied this patch to 2.3.2. I m confused though about the structure of SpanScorer vs. QueryScorer. Why does SpanScorer require the stream of source text tokens i.e. SpanScorer Query query String field CachingTokenFilter cachingTokenFilter while QueryScorer does not i.e. QueryScorer Query query String fieldName Intuitively if QueryScorer is scoring based on the number of unique query terms found in the document wouldn t the stream of source text tokens be necessary for this calculation I m wondering a why is this not necessary in QueryScorer and b what makes it necessary in SpanScorer I m having some trouble understanding the code and was wondering if I could get any guidance . Thanks Tavi FYI This has been applied to the trunk as well. The SpanScorer needs a TokenStream because it shoves the stream into a MemoryIndex and transforms the query into a Span approximation to find hit positions. This approach was used for compatibility with the current API. The QueryScorer simply scores each Token that is in the query as well as the TokenStream - so it just needs to extract the terms from the query and find overlap with the TokenStream passed to the getFragments method. This is not position sensitive. The SpanScorer works the same way but it also fills the MemoryIndex and gets matching Spans so that Terms in the wrong position score a 0 during Highlighter Term scoring again getBestFragments or whatever . The approach was mainly dictated by the old API. Fitting into the current API seemed the most practical efficient way to get a position sensitive Highlighter in the short term. On Mon Jun 23 2008 at 7 51 PM Tavi Nathanson JIRA jira apache.org Hey everyone I m having some trouble getting SpanScorer to act the way I d like for proper highlighting and I m wondering if anyone has any suggestions. I have two fields text raw and text stemmed. text raw as the name suggests stores unstemmed tokenized text while text stemmed stores stemmed tokenized text. I have queries that look over both fields. For example I may have the query text raw apple sauce text stemmed orange . This query matches apple sauce oranges but it does not match apples sauces orange because apple sauce is not stemmed . I d like to be able to highlight accordingly I want apple sauce and oranges to all be highlighted. So even though it is in fact the raw text that ends up getting highlighted I m looking for a way to build SpanScorer such that I don t need to limit myself to one field field is one of the arguments to the constructor . Thanks Tavi Hey Tavi Try passing null as the field. Mark
