Change Visibility of fields in MultiFieldQueryParser
In MultiFieldQueryParser the two methods protected Query getFuzzyQuery String field String termStr float minSimilarity throws ParseException protected Query getWildcardQuery String field String termStr throws ParseException are intended to be overwritten if one would like to avoid fuzzy and wildcard queries. However the String fields attribute of this class is private and hence it is not accessible in subclasses of MFQParser. If you just change it to protected this issue should be solved. This code is a little bit twisted took me a while to figure out how it was working. I m wondering what you want to do with the variables if they re available ... not that I m terribly against making them protected or adding gettter setters but I see another issue here. The code right now takes two paths if you pass a field it just calls QP via super. If you don t pass a field it loops through each of the fields it has which I suspect is usually what one wants. But in this loop it also calls super which means you don t get a chance in your derived class to override it again. I think it would make more sense to not call super in the loop case. So derived classes can get access to the call both when no field is passed and when each field is passed. Out of curiosity would this do anything for you If these were to be made protected would you just be writing the loop yourself This patch allows the recursive per-field calls in MFQP to be overridden by not forcing them to super. All tests pass. Makes sense. Thanks Steve applied. I left those 2 private attributes of MFQP as private until somebody asks for them to be protected.
