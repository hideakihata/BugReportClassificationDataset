Elision filter for simple french analyzing
If you don t wont to use stemming StandardAnalyzer miss some french strangeness like elision. l avion wich means the plane must be tokenized as avion plane . This filter could be used with other latin language if elision exists. i don t know much about french but a few comments... 1 stopwords seems like an odd name for what i would think of as a prefix .. you may want an example in the javadocs to make it clear. 2 are Elison s always lowercase I imagine there should be an ignoreCase option just like StopFilter has. note that toLowerCase is hardcoded in the next method but nothing ensures that the stopwords list is lowercased 3 are there any other characters that can appear between an elision and it s root word besides i m particularly wondering about other unicode characters that look like byte 0x27 but are not actually 0x27 4 this probably doesn t need to be in it s own contrib. contrib analyzers should be fine .... if Elison s are specific to french then contrib analyzers src java org apache lucene analysis fr makes the most sense otherwise it might make sense to add a new subpackage under analysis ... linguistics perhaps in contrast to the existing ngram All suggested corrections are done. All suggested corrections are done. Patch applied thanks. I reformatted the code to match Lucene style. I also put the Apache license on top of both files. Thanks
