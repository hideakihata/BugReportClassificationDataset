Code cleanup from all sorts of trivial warnings
I would like to do some code cleanup and remove all sorts of trivial warnings like unnecessary casts problems w javadocs unused variables redundant null checks unnecessary semicolon etc. These are all very trivial and should not pose any problem. I ll create another issue for getting rid of deprecated code usage like LuceneTestCase and all sorts of deprecated constructors. That s also trivial because it only affects Lucene code but it s a different type of change. Another issue I d like to create is about introducing more generics in the code where it s missing today - not changing existing API. There are many places in the code like that. So with you permission I ll start with the trivial ones first and then move on to the others. Can someone please clarify these for me Description Class Line Unsupported SuppressWarnings SerializableHasSerializationMethods TestCustomScoreQuery.java 87 Unsupported SuppressWarnings SerializableHasSerializationMethods TestCustomScoreQuery.java 123 Unsupported SuppressWarnings UseOfSystemOutOrSystemErr TestFieldScoreQuery.java 42 Unsupported SuppressWarnings UseOfSystemOutOrSystemErr TestOrdValues.java 37 Are these meant to be there and eclipse just doesn t recognize them for some reason or are these a mistake I ll create another issue for getting rid of deprecated code usage like LuceneTestCase and all sorts of deprecated constructors. At the moment this is not simple as there are LocalizedTestCase which is not easy to transform to JUnit4. In my opinion the deprecation of the TestCase base class should be reverted. And also most people here inlcuding me are not willing to add these stupid Test everywhere when writing tests so we only transform testcases that would speedup with BeforeClass AfterClass creating a read-only index only one time per class e.g. see NRQ tests . About the SuppressWarnings These are some from other compilers a Java compiler is required to ignore all unknown ones so they dont hurt. But for cleanness we only want to have Sun javac compile annotations and of course Override not for interfaces Java 1.5 Deprecated. Another issue I d like to create is about introducing more generics in the code where it s missing today - not changing existing API Which places do you mean The public apis are 100 generics maybe some internal parts. Some additional requirement Please avoid autoboxing If you cleanup the code use in all cases the Eclipse code style from the Wiki contributor page . We have an updated one with generics support .. not willing to add these stupid Test everywhere I don t share the same feeling ... I think it s a strong capability - write a method which doesn t need to start w testXYZ just to be run by JUnit though I do both for clarity . I think moving to JUnit 4 only simplifies things as it allows testing classes w o the need to extend TestCase. But I m not going to argue about it here I d like to keep this issue contained and short. So I won t touch the LuceneTestCase deprecation as it s still controversial judging by what you say. I ll remove those SuppressWarnings then About generics there are the internal parts of the code like using List ArrayList etc. Scanning quickly through the list it looks like most of the Lucene related warnings are about referencing them ... so it should be also easy to fix. I ll take a look at the code style settings http wiki.apache.org lucene-java HowToContribute action AttachFile do view target Eclipse-Lucene-Codestyle.xml but I m talking about compiler warnings. I don t share the same feeling ... I think it s a strong capability - write a method which doesn t need to start w testXYZ just to be run by JUnit though I do both for clarity . I think moving to JUnit 4 only simplifies things as it allows testing classes w o the need to extend TestCase. But I m not going to argue about it here I d like to keep this issue contained and short. So I won t touch the LuceneTestCase deprecation as it s still controversial judging by what you say. This was discussed lots of times in JIRA and frenode IRC lucene . The important thing is We want all testcases in lucene to be extended from one class if Junit4 it s LuceneTestcaseJ4 because we have some additional checks that should be run before after each test FieldCache checkups merge scheduler tests reproducing random test seeds ... I ll remove those SuppressWarnings then Yes I remove them only whenever i see them. At the moment such code cleanup and if they also affect whitespace cleanup have the problem that they make merging with the new flex branch flexible indexing harder so the most important thing is to not simply reformat all the code. When adding generics please use the above eclipse codesyste as we don t want to have whitespace after commas inside generics. About generics there are the internal parts of the code like using List ArrayList etc. Scanning quickly through the list it looks like most of the Lucene related warnings are about referencing them ... so it should be also easy to fix. Last time I opened Lucene inside Eclipse only produced one type of warning Use of raw type - but this warning only affected instanceof checks. This is stupid and a bug in Eclipse. Instanceof checks can never be generic as the tests is useless at runtime. So a check for instance of ArrayList without generics is perfectly fine. Adding generics make you feel that there is some compiler check or runtime checks both of them are not done. Instanceof is runtime-only and can never check any generics. So I am against those checks But if you find some unneeded casts and missing generics in general 1. The instanceof warnings can somehow be switched off in Eclipse dont know how. For coding i dont use IDEs only for automatic refactoring . I forgot Lucene should compile with javac without warnings - and this is working. How about if I undeprecate LuceneTestCase for now and if there will be a decision to remove it then we ll remove it It will eliminate lots of deprecation warnings. About the generics - any reason why not have a space after commas inside generics About the generics - any reason why not have a space after commas inside generics See the mailing list. And it is done like that everywhere in current luecen s source tree. And you have no problem just use the codestyle xml file for the project and you are done. http www.lucidimagination.com search document 62fe00098351dbe3 whitespace inside generics parameters See the mailing list. What does it mean What should I look for Is it related to undeprecate LuceneTestCase If so can you give me the short answer - yes no What does it mean Sorry I chnaged my comment above. Ok I m fine w the formatting. What about un-deprecating LuceneTestCase for now Ok I m fine w the formatting. What about un-deprecating LuceneTestCase for now 1 I wanted to do this already but forgot about it. Uwe what should I do w Version.LUCENE CURRENT It is deprecated however lots of tests are using it. Do they need to reference LUCENE 31 What will happen in future versions Every release we ll change all the tests I remember a discussion about this just trying to figure out how to change the tests now. There is an issue open about that ignore it please Simon Willnauer will repair that. You have to use LuceneTestCase.TEST VERSION CURRENT as all tests extends one of LuceneTestCase -J4 it is simple to refactor using sed . By the way there are lots of tests that are explicitely testing deprecated APIs so warnings are fine. We know about compile warnings there but do not change them to work differnt how should we - we can only add SuppressWarning deprecated to them. I would suggest that you ignore tests and only look at the main class files. Thanks for the concerns Uwe I ve noticed the tests that test deprecated code and I know better than to try to fix them ... uploading the patch now Quite a large patch. I ve started off with 3832 compiler warnings based on my eclipse settings and we re now down to 510. All tests pass including core contrib and tag. I ve also fixed a bunch of javadocs warnings and ant javadocs now passes cleanly. I did not do any formatting to the code in order to preserve the patch as clear and focused as possible even though it s a very large one ... It touches a lot of files. So the sooner someone can help me commit it the better before these files change . I will look into it some of the changes are problematic because they appear in generated classes like QueryParser so i will leave that out. Also SuppressWarnings unused is not a javac annotation. Thanks for fixing the javadoc warnings and cleaning up some import statements. As far as I see you did duplicate work and replaced all LUCENE CURRENT constants in tests so I may close the other bug report when committing this too. This may take some time Hi Shai I applied the patch to my checkout so it will not get out-of date. As mentioned before I have to review each change as on my first diagonal look-around I found a removed cast in TestCharArraySet Map that is important to call the right method without the cast the test would pass but the affected method is never called. I am also not want to remove some casts in NumericRange and other parts where the casts were added for more clearness in code. Especially at some places without the cast it is not clear what javac will do so the cast is for more security even if not needed. So please excuse by complaints but two people looking over such a large patch is really needed. Thanks for the work Uwe some of the changes are problematic because they appear in generated classes like QueryParser So All I did was remove unnecessary semicolons and casts ... next time those files will be generated the warnings will return. But at least until then we can live w few less warnings ... which will allow my perfectionist eyes to rest a little . replaced all LUCENE CURRENT constants in tests Yes I figured I m already touching these files let s do it all at once. Reduced another 300 warnings. About the removed casts - eclipse really warns you on unnecessary casts. I have never found a case where it was wrong. The removed cast from TestCharArraySet is justified because you want to test the contains Object method which is exactly what happens. In fact when I look at the code I think there is a wrong cast assertFalse CharArraySet.EMPTY SET.contains Object foo invokes the contains Object method assertFalse CharArraySet.EMPTY SET.contains foo .toCharArray invokes the contains Object method assertFalse CharArraySet.EMPTY SET.contains foo .toCharArray 0 3 invokes the contains char int int method If the intention was to check all 3 contains methods then the first cast should have been to CharSequence Anyway the removed cast the second which cast to Object is justified as it s indeed unnecessary. Also SuppressWarnings unused is not a javac annotation Are you sure I have another project which compiles w javac and it works fine. I ll check it but I trust you . About adding casts for clarity of code - I guess that s a matter of styling but the cast is truly unnecessary and just produces a warning. I would like the code to be free of those but that s only my opinion. The removed cast from TestCharArraySet is justified because you want to test the contains Object method which is exactly what happens. In fact when I look at the code I think there is a wrong cast This is not true Index src test org apache lucene analysis TestCharArrayMap.java src test org apache lucene analysis TestCharArrayMap.java revision 916146 src test org apache lucene analysis TestCharArrayMap.java working copy -76 7 76 7 int n 0 for Object o cs assertTrue cm.containsKey o - assertTrue cm.containsKey char o assertTrue cm.containsKey o n assertEquals hm.size n Index src test org apache lucene analysis TestCharArraySet.java src test org apache lucene analysis TestCharArraySet.java revision 916146 src test org apache lucene analysis TestCharArraySet.java working copy -475 7 475 7 assertFalse CharArraySet.EMPTY SET.contains stopword assertFalse CharArraySet.EMPTY SET.contains Object foo - assertFalse CharArraySet.EMPTY SET.contains Object foo .toCharArray assertFalse CharArraySet.EMPTY SET.contains foo .toCharArray assertFalse CharArraySet.EMPTY SET.contains foo .toCharArray 0 3 The problem here is We have a char and a Object method. The check tests that also the Object method accepts char . This is important if you cast CharArraySet to java.util.Set and call with char . So removin the cast for this test is simply wrong. You can check this with Clover. And you patch even adds the same check two times - instead of forcing the right method. And by the way When I run ant and it compiles I get no warning message at all. Are you sure I have another project which compiles w javac and it works fine. I ll check it but I trust you . As I said before java compiles need to simply ignore unknown SuppressWarnings see Java Language specs . It s only Eclipse that is to over About adding casts for clarity of code - I guess that s a matter of styling but the cast is truly unnecessary and just produces a warning. I would like the code to be free of those but that s only my opinion. Yes its a matter of styling because of the same we don t want to have autoboxing in internal lucene code because autoboxing has a speed impact for some of Lucene s code like collectors . So we want to see what happens. I want to understand that I apply a char - int conversion especially in our new TokenFilters you can get a problem very fast as Character-methods are very sensitive if called with char or int from the Unicode part. And I say it again javac shows no warning so I don t see any need to change this just because this Eclipse prints a useless warning. But you can switch them off. I have some warnings i simply swicth off after creating a project with eclipse. Like the problem with generified instanceof checks which are a bug in Eclipse. Uwe your examples are still wrong. CharArrayMap has 3 methods containsKey CharSequence containsKey Object and containsKey char int int . There is no contains char . Therefore when you cast to char the Object method is the one that s called not that char int int. If I change the code to assertTrue cm.containsKey char o 0 char o .length then the right method is invoked. So I guess the tests were defected in the first place .. and like I said eclipse doesn t lie when it says a cast is unnecessary at least I haven t seen such a case yet. I ll fix those two tests now because they were defective right from the beginning. Thanks for spotting this because you ve just revealed a bug which existed in the tests . because of the same we don t want to have autoboxing in internal lucene code I don t see how autoboxing is related to casting ... If a map returns an Integer and you assign it to int then whether or not you ll do the cast it will autounbox it. If you assign it to an Integer then you won t be able to cast to int I think and hence the cast is redundant as well. About Character methods eclipse is smart enough to detect that when you call a method w a char type then the right one is called vs. if you call it with the int type. Hovering over the method call reveals immediately the method variant that s called. So I see no reason why a char would be need to cast to char . If you want to call an int variant method then you ll need to cast to int and eclipse won t complain about that. Switching off compiler warnings in eclipse is your choice ... the Lucene code is full of hidden casting because that s how Java works. When you do int 1.0 it s cast to double and people are aware of that ... in fact they have to assign the result to a double or they ll be forced to cast to anything else. When you work w integers and the method returns a long it s cast automatically. So if there are few cases where you d want to alert the user put it in a comment or like int charint int c Like I said it s a styling issue. I m not going to turn off my warnings in eclipse ... and I don t understand what s this generified instanceof checks - can you give an example Fixes TestCharArrayMap Test original bug. Like I said it s a styling issue. I m not going to turn off my warnings in eclipse ... and I don t understand what s this generified instanceof checks - can you give an example http javanotepad.blogspot.com 2007 09 instanceof-doesnt-work-with-generics.html So if you try to do if list instanceof ArrayList Type it throws compiler error. But my Eclipse here complains at about 400 places that there are missing generics in these instanceof checks. Instanceof checks are always raw and can never use generics it makes no sense . Example Open eclipse and look into warnings CharArraySet.equals uses raw type. Javac does not complain but Eclipse wants to fix with if map instanceof UnmodifiableCharArrayMap - this is bullshit and helps nobody. The Java language spec and Sun s Generics Howto clearly say that instanceof checks should use raw types. Thanks for the info Uwe. I don t have this setting turned on and I agree it s not necessary even though it might be useful. So we are on the same page. I didn t fix any such warnings and I don t see any such warnings ... Did you look at the updated patch I uploaded Do you agree understand the problem those tests had before and why the cast is indeed redundant Could you also let me know what parts of the patch you decided to omit I ve spent a lot of time clearing those warnings and I d hate to see a large portion of them come back for no good reason. hello i wanted to give my opinion on a few things thanks for doing this cleanup work there is a lot of good changes in here. as far as any flex merging troubles i will volunteer to help with that problem. I only have one real concern I am not a generics policeman like Uwe so please continue with him i like the removal of casts etc but i would prefer if we did not do this with auto-gen d snowball code. the only reason is i am trying to track changes over there against over here. it is true we changed a few things in the base class SnowballProgram so that millions of reflections string creations do not happen but these are all listed at the top along with the svn rev we are using. The Among and gen ed code is actually now directly synced up... for now. In truth i hate modifying this code as I hate the idea of us diverging from their codebase but i think the performance gains no reflection creating many stringbuilders and strings etc are worth it. The problem is I don t think our local modifications are best overall for other uses of snowball or i would submit them to that project and sync that way. For example they would rather create a new StringBuilder for every input word than run the risk of the stemmer keeping reference to a potentially large string for us this is not a good tradeoff. I think the cleanup here is great thanks Shai . We don t get enough patches cleaning things up so they are always welcome... And the fact that Eclipse detection of an unecessary cast lead to catching the bug in TestCharSet Map not calling the method we thought it was calling is also great. The move to Junit4 appears to be controversial so I agree we should handle it separately. I don t think difficulty merging to the flex branch really applies here... we should try hard not to allow the existence of flex branch to make life harder slower on trunk. We well Mark Uwe Robert thanks merge huge changes over to flex every so often. And I d like to land flex soonish hopefully so we don t have to do that anymore... Probably we shouldn t change generated code unless really necessary I think it can just cause confusion down the road when someone not us generates and then is baffled why all these new Eclipse warnings appeared In fact I think ideally our build would always regen all gen d code. This way if we screw up by accidentally editing only the gen d code and not the source which I ve done at least 2 or 3 times we find out quickly... it d keep us honest. I think it doesn t matter one way or another if we do the TEST VERSION CURRENT cutover here or under the existing issue. Looks like Uwe will be committing both anyway Hi Shai I will review your patch over the weekend and commit all changes except Snowball files QueryParser and other autogenerated files removed casts but only those who are important to prevent bugs in future explicit long to prevent overflows Ð we added lots of them if we remove them somebody who changes the code will not be aware that an overflow may occur - see MMapDirectory char int conversions in analyzers. I will for sure keep the removal of unused pre-generics casts. The TEST VERSION CURRENT changes will be committed in a separate patch. After I had done this i will post an updated patch here. It this an option Robert - I actually thought about whether or not to change the Snowball code. In my internal project I also make use of Snowball code directly and improved it to fit better in the analysis process. I should actually diff my changes w yours perhaps I can use yours or contribute mine. But all I did is get rid of using deprecated methods. I didn t remove any casts I think but actually added ones in order to not use the deprecated API. But from what you say I understand why you prefer to leave the code as-is. It ll make comparison w the source Snowball easier. So I m fine w leaving this part out. Perhaps we can just add a SuppressWarning to not see the deprecated warnings That should be fairly easy to skip over when comparing the sources in the future. Uwe Michael - your reasoning about QueryParser makes sense to me. I have a Tokenizer well few actually generated by JFlex and I clean up warnings as well. But that s me where I have full control over the code and I don t mean just commit rights - if anything gets rebuilt it s because I ve decided to do it. Therefore I m ok w leaving these out. I think what I ve added to QueryParser though is a general SuppressWarnings above the class declaration in the .jj file . That shouldn t be left out right I mean what problems can it cause But if you feel otherwise I won t stop you . TEST VERSION CURRENT - I think if it s already included in that patch why not commit it here I m not looking for credit or anything just to save Uwe s work. Separating it out from this patch and including it over in the other issue is just extra work ... but Uwe - it s your time that s spent so I won t tell you how to manage it . Uwe about the important casts my preference is to include a suitable comment. I.e. if you have a code that looks like long val long otherval just to avoid overflow then that s not clear anyway. Someone can still change it to int val otherval w o knowing understanding that he just broke something. These types of casts are anyhow redundant as I don t believe someone will change them. Nowadays w 64-bit machines compilers and OSs keeping your stuff as long does not matter much I mean as variables not as elements in an array . It ll be interesting to see how this patch turns out eventually. All I cared about is reducing the number of warnings. If we can keep the Snowball QueryParser stuff under a SuppressWarnings annotations then that will do the trick as well . Thanks everybody for looking into this Hi Shai here is the patch with the above changes. I also improved some more inconsistencies in Test code. Thanks for removing all this useless null checks after new . In contrib QueryParser s Attribute s equals I removed the useless null check at all you only exchanged the clauses as null instance AnyClass always returns false so the check is useless and for equals which should be optimized not needed. I left the TEST VERSION CURRENT changes in Will close the other issue LUCENE-2251 after commit. At some places I left the casts but only where I want to have them in all places. After committing I will provide a diffed patch of the rest of your changes for more review so they do not get lost . I will commit this in a day. Uwe I ve applied the patch and in Analyzers I see lots of compile errors due to unrecognized Version.LUCENE CURRENT there is a missing import . I thought that you let TEST VERSION CURRENT in no I changed all the contrib the tests to extend from LuceneTestCase and use it. Perhaps you mistakenly left it out Actually all errors I see are related to Version unrecognized. Hi Shai I applied the patch to a fresh checkout and get no compile errors. Are you sure that the patch applied correctly I am working in Windows so if you are not using a patch-apply tool like TortoiseSVN that can accept windows line endings you have to maybe use dos2unix before And don t forget to update your package in Eclipse press F5 . I had this type of errors very often because Eclipse caches the sources. All tests pass here and no compile errors also in demo webapp and so on using ANT . Maybe the patch is also outdated i goes against Revision 916685 maybe you can downgrade your checkout using svn up -r916685 patch and upgrade again. I use TortoiseSVN s TortoiseMerge patch tool which is more intelligent and also applies very old patches wizthout problems. It works like the new svn patch in svn 1.7x trunk It uses the revision numbers in the patch s file headers and fetches automatically the requested version patches it and then updates it to the version of your checkout. By that it makes use of the standard update tools of svn and patches always apply without any moved HUNK problems and so on. Ok I see the problem now - because there are so many files I didn t see while applying the patch that there are errors mismatch on some files therefore the patch wasn t applied to them hence the compile errors. I apply the patch w eclipse. The problematic files are tests in the analyzers package and I suspect it s an encoding issue. My source encoding is UTF-8 yet still when I apply the patch I see different characters on the source and patch file. Not sure where the problem is. The patch file which I downloaded is UTF-8 as well and TestArabicAnalyzer for example contains the correct characters in Arabic in both the patch file and my checkout copy . Yet still when I apply the patch eclipse doesn t read it as UTF-8 ... Uwe how about if we do this issue in multiple commits I.e. commit what you ve done so far which is what we agree on then I can update review the remaining warnings and we continue from there Anyway after you commit this there will be warnings and over time more warnings will creep in so we ll need to do some cleanup again . Is that acceptable Strange ... something s wrong w eclipse and how it read the patch file I tried to apply the patch which I created originally and was on my computer not downloaded from JIRA and it fails on the same files ... any ideas Googling around I see it s a known problem in Eclipse w no solution yet at least I haven t come across one . Uwe - can you proceed w the commit like I suggested and then we review the remaining warnings Strange ... something s wrong w eclipse and how it read the patch file I tried to apply the patch which I created originally and was on my computer not downloaded from JIRA and it fails on the same files ... any ideas No sorry. I don t use Eclipse at all only for some refactoring. I will commit the patch at the weekend and then update a second svn tree with your old patch applied. svn up then makes it able to provide a patch with the left out changes we don t want to apply some casts sorry and we won t fix them . I just say it again it compiles without any warnings using javac we cannot support stupiud warnings of other IDEs during our development as Eclipse is no official requirement. So I still strongy suggest to disable some of the warnings already mentioned. Ok perhaps you misunderstood me. I suggested to commit your version of the patch and then afterwards we can discuss the remaining warnings that are controversial. We both agree on your version. We disagree on the diff right So let s start w yours and then we can continue arguing about the rest . I understood that I just wanted to say that some warnings will reappear with my patch because I removed lots of generated code. Thats all I wanted to say Sorry I don t want to nitpick - this issue is somehow about different opinions on code style and warnings - e.g. i totally aggree with renaming private vars that hide protected ones and so on. I also want to fix generics I am the official generics police g . But i simply want something in the code that explains the code better and prevents future errors even if it is a cast too much. I also applied the unused variable fixes although in test I think its better to just add a fake local variable and place a SupressWarning unchecked before it you cannot apply this annotation to simple statements . So your compiler complains about unused variables - but how to fix that without placing the SuppressWarnings before the method Which is bad as I want to only place it before one code line. In TestVirtualMethod I fixed this by splitting the bigger test method into two smaller ones only one with SuppressWarnings. But I still prefer to assign to a local unused var to be able to place the annotation before maybe thats a bug in Java5 that you cannot add annotations to single statements . Maybe do some fake operation on the variable like an assertion to mark it used g. Ok then we understand each other. Indeed I have a different opinion about casts. They are called unnecessary because of a reason. When a method declares it returns an int there no reason to cast a char to an int. The compiler will do it for you. More than that if the method will declare it returns a long in the future the cast will generate a compile error. Styling like that always generate lots of opinions . We shouldn t however limit ourselves to only two opinions. The fact that you are not using Eclipse and therefore don t see all the warnings doesn t mean the rest of us who do use eclipse should see them. If they are justified then ok but otherwise saying javac does not complain is just not enough for me. Eclipse is where I spend a large portion of my day in ... So I suggest we get more opinions from others. It s not just about what you or I think ... but we can do this after the larger portion of the warnings is removed. When a method declares it returns an int there no reason to cast a char to an int. The compiler will do it for you. I aggree with that those casts were left in the patch no problem at all. For me it is a problem esp. in some file handling methods that use longs but sometimes also use ints e.g. when reading a block of data . One example MMapDirectory had a lot of problems with integer overflows in the past. The problems occurred because some formulas were simply not using casts at all so the compiler did what was in the specs but which is not always easy to see. So if you explicitely add a cast to long in your formula you are fine and really nobody gets hurt. An everybody understands whats happening. The Sun Code formatting guidelines explicitely says that that you should use integer casts if it is for more clarity. And if you dont like the warnings then switch them off for only lucene in eclipse you dont need to do that globally . I dont agree with using char inside a method when calling other functions without casting to int. E.g. we have some backwards compatibility layer for Unicode 4 that uses Character.toUpperCase int and Character.toUpperCase char in parallel. And these two methods differ so i explicitely cast to be sure which method is called that was especially important for Lucene 2.9 in Java 1.4 when compiled with Java 5 - because the javac could use the wrong method without casting to char even with -source 1.4 -target 1.4 etc. For easy merging to 2.9 as it is still supported I want to keep the casts. Thats all. If you like add some SuppressWarnings foobar to it if you would be happy. More than that if the method will declare it returns a long in the future the cast will generate a compile error. Changing return values of public methods will never happen. And if somebody would do this by accident the cast helps to find the error Ð thats only a funny addition. Googling around I see it s a known problem in Eclipse w no solution yet at least I haven t come across one . Uwe - can you proceed w the commit like I suggested and then we review the remaining warnings this drives me nuts. here s what you can do copy the entire patch to clipboard then apply patch from clipboard no encoding problems. copy the entire patch to clipboard Super Robert That worked Now that I apply the patch I m back to 1 400 warnings 900 up . Many of them related to generated code and Snowball but here are few comments AnalyzingQueyrParser contrib misc line 144 wlist cannot be null at this point because it is created line 80 as new ArrayList. The same should be removed in line 161 though Eclipse does not complain which is weird. But wlist cannot be null. Besides the entire code segment in lines 158-164 can be improved but let s leave it outside the scope of this issue. TestCharacterUtils - Uwe note how there are many unnecessary casts to int from char while the actual assert method that s called is a long . Do you still think these are required UnicodeUtil - the chars are cast to int in code like this int utf32 int str.charAt i 1 Is that necessary too Besides these I m fine w the rest. Still a 2400 warnings reduction and many of the ones left are either in generated code or related to deliberate use of deprecated API. In my internal project I also make use of Snowball code directly and improved it to fit better in the analysis process. I should actually diff my changes w yours perhaps I can use yours or contribute mine. I d be curious to know what you did if its possible for you to I d like to hear what you did maybe on the list so it wont be lost on this issue my recent mods to snowball itself are on LUCENE-2194 LUCENE-2201. I think previously Karl modified it so that it doesnt use reflection except the Lovins stemmer I d be curious to know what you did Ok now you ve made me compare the two . I m happy to see we both did the same thing only you call your buffer current while I call it buf . Besides that I ve included a static final EMPTY ARGS instead of all the places where new Object 0 is passed. Nothing too fancy. Another thing is that I wrote an Arabic and Hebrew stemmer and combined them w the Snowball ones by introducing a stemmer class which can be either Snowball or anything else. I ll check if we re allowed to contribute the Hebrew stemmer to Lucene ... BTW FYI - our legal department forbid us to use the Hungarian stemmer because of licensing legal issues. Besides the stemmers that were originally provided the Snowball project accepted additional ones like the Hungarian stemmer. However for that one we weren t able to get a confirmation from the contributor his University indeed gave him permission to contribute the code. Don t know if it matters to anyone here I ve notified Martin Porter as well but FYI. Our legal department does not permit us to use it which is not surprising - they are legal ... . I don t want to derail this issue into Snowball discussion so if you want to talk about it I suggest we move it to the list. UnicodeUtil I reverted the whole class as it is very sensitive to binary encoding so please leave it as it is. Tell me any SuppressWarnings parameter that makes eclipse happy I will add it TestCharacterUtils I missed that this test is junit4 in junit3 the casts are necessary. But if you bug me longer with these casts I will give the issue to somebody else AnalyzingQueyrParser I simply reverted everything with QueryParser in it because it is normally generated code. As I said before let us first commit this patch. But i will no longer discuss about casts Thanks for reviewing the patch its a good help to get code cleaner I will commit the current patch soon and post the remaing diff of Shais original patch to the issue. Committed revision 917019 I will attach the open changes as separate patch. Please reopen if new changes. Here for reference the remaining changes of Shai that I rejected mostly casts which in my opinion should stay . Important The UnicodeUtils for example are not tested in a way that it is really sure that missing casts do not change the code at all. In my opinion this should stay like it is. The smaller one LUCENE-2285-remaining.patch contains the real changes. The bigger one LUCENE-2285-remaining generated.patch also changes in generated code just for reference . Thanks Uwe for committing this. I think that further discussion is pointless if you feel that I bug you and you will no longer discuss about casts ... Kind of kills any chance of having a serious and open discussion. I can live with the code as it is now ... If someone else feels otherwise then I don t mind to continue discuss this. Hi Shai sorry in my opinion the discussion seems to be stuck as both of us have a personal opinion about the casts and it seems that both of us always presenting the same arguments so in my opinion someone else should jump into the discussion. My point is simple that I want to have the casts for documentation purposes and safety reasons so later changes in the code will be obvious and anybody reading the code is able to follow. This only affects casts to long and int - char . I presented my arguments Especially for backwards compatibility as long as the 2.9 branch is maintained the argument about casting int - char in code that may get merged to 2.9 branch I tested it and broke my 2.9 build A JDK 5 compiler even with -target 1.4 and -source 1.4 would use the Character methods taking int params as the JDK5 has it in their rt.jar. If you compile with a JDK 1.4 compiler the compiler will automatically cast to char as no int method is available. I tested this in my 2.9 branch i removed the casts at some places the code compiled fine with 1.5 compiler but when running the tests with JDK 1.4 MethodNotFound exceptions occurred. When I also compiled with the 1.4 compiler the resulting jar was fine. So forcing the compiler to use char methods or int methods especially in those Unicode stuff is important. Maybe you understand my argument now. And also when going from 1.5 to 1.6 so compiling 1.5 code in 1.6 may break in the same way. So I prefer to tell the compiler the method to use. And for these reasons I don t understand why you insist in removing those casts. Eclipse declaring them as warnings is in my opinion wrong and should maybe an info message as everybody is free to add casts and not rely on automatic casting. The same affects autoboxing if you dont like autoboxing you should be free to explicitely say how the values should be converted. As Lucenes Collectors are hotspots automboxing without control may affect performance So adding explicit boxing and explicit casts is a good idea although YOU think they are wrong or unneeded. As I dont use eclipse I have no idea about the correct parameter I would suggest to add a SuppressWarnings foobar for supressing those cast messages in the affected classes. Would this be an option You will get no warnings and I can preserve my casts. If you have other improvements in non-generated code I would be happy to commit the patches. I also merged your patch yesterday to the flex branch so Mike and Robert can also use it in the flexible indexing branch. So again thank you for the improvements. Uwe we are indeed deadlocked . I thought that it s not recommended to compile code w 1.5 and run it w 1.4 even if the source level is 1.4. I remember a couple of issues with that especially using Java 5.0 methods such as Class.getSimpleName I remember because I introduced these problems . So I m not sure that I buy this argument ... And I don t think that int int32 int str.charAt i 1 introduces any sorts of safety or makes the code clearer more readable. It s just a redundant cast which has no effect because the compiler would cast to int even if you didn t put the cast explicitly there. Same as doing double res double intval 1.0 ... I guess we need a tie breaker . hi Shai i will give some comment on your example here. it doesnt really matter to me either way BUT i think the cast helps here somewhat this is the part of the code confirming a valid surrogate pair . Because if i see int32 something.charAt I immediately think bug as the right-hand-side is a 16 bit code unit. The cast makes me think the person writing the code is aware they are not the same data type. Thanks Robert. I understand the reasoning behind what you say. I d still prefer a comment which IMO would really show someone has given thought to this. But I m fine or maybe just tired either way as well .. I just hope no one else will take my side now because we ll be tied again . Shai its no big deal to me either way and I agree a comment would better explain what is happening in this part of UnicodeUtil versus a cast so replacing the cast with a comment to me is fine. Funny how the word trivial appears in the subject . I once heard that if you ll try to pass two decisions among a group of people 1 would be a better name for a department and 2 would be spending 1B on a super complicated science project you ll have better luck w the second . Let s leave the cast ... I m afraid if I ll add the comment we ll argue about the wording . I thought that it s not recommended to compile code w 1.5 and run it w 1.4 even if the source level is 1.4. I remember a couple of issues with that especially using Java 5.0 methods such as Class.getSimpleName I remember because I introduced these problems . So I m not sure that I buy this argument ... This affects code merged into the 2.9 branch. The release artifacts of Lucene 2.9 are compiled with Java 1.5 as else some contribs would not compile need 1.5 . So we had to take care that we dont use methods from 1.5. This is tested by the release manager by a compile using JDK 1.4 core only . Ð I did this. The problem is now that in my above example without the cast when calling Character.toUpperCase using an non-casted int the rt.jar of javac leads the compiler to using the int version of the method even if it is not available in 1.4. By using a explicit cast we are fine here. I tested this during my 2.9 release builds I used the artifacts from the bin-zip and was able to run the tests using JDK 1.4. When I remove some of the int - char casts it breaks. Thats all. This is one reason why i prefer to be explicit about the invoked method. A commented out cast would not help so I am -1 on just adding casts as comment. So please tell me a SuppressWarnings that I can add to make your IDE happy. The SuppressWarnings is unused . But I don t want to add it as it will ignore any such warnings in the file. What you write about 1.4 1.5 makes perfect sense to me. I don t mind staying w the warnings if the code had a comment we must do this cast to avoid a 1.4 1.5 compatibility issue . So please don t add SuppressWarnings. To me once the community has decided a certain warning is justified it s enough. I don t need Eclipse to be happy I ll talk to it privately afterwards explaining the situation . Thanks for the example and explanation. Of course it would not be needed for Lucene 3.1. But we still merge a lot of bugfix code back so the casts ensure that it can be done easily. This one warning in one of the contrib queryparsers i reverted even not generated code will be added later. I think the biggest change in this issue was removal of Version.LUCENE CURRENT in tests. There are still some places where LUCENE CURRENT is used in core code. I will close the linked issue now.
