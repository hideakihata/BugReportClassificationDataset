Extend Codec with a SegmentInfos writer reader
I m trying to implement a Codec that works with append-only filesystems HDFS . It s almost done except for the SegmentInfos.write dir which uses ChecksumIndexOutput which in turn uses IndexOutput.seek - and seek is not supported on append-only output. I propose to extend the Codec interface to encapsulate also the details of SegmentInfos writing reading. Patch to follow after some feedback This sounds great I ve wanted to let Codecs store stuff into each SegmentInfo eg the hasProx boolean really ought not be a core thing but a Codec-private flag instead . Maybe this is a way to do that... The only odd thing is... Codec is per-segment now. Every segment is free to have a different Codec even within a single session of IW . So having Codec write the segments file doesn t really fit I guess CodecProvider could do so Multiple segments files can exist in the index at a time the requirement would then be that the current CodecProvider must always be able to read all segments files written by past CodecProviders. We could alternatively make it an option for IW to use a normal IndexOutput when writing segments files skipping the checksum . Once you remove this from HDFS how will you ensure the written segments file is consistent Or is this a possibly partially written segments file due to eg OS crash or power loss on ordinary filesystems never an issue with HDFS Or we can force the same Codec for the whole index. Which really makes sense. This was committed as a part of LUCENE-2373.
