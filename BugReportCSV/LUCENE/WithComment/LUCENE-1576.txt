Brazilian Analyzer doesn t remove stopwords when uppercase is given
The order of filters matter here just need to apply lowercase token filter before removing stopwords result new StopFilter result stoptable result new BrazilianStemFilter result excltable Convert to lowercase after stemming result new LowerCaseFilter result Lowercase must come before BrazilianStemFilter At the end of day I ll attach a patch it s straightforward FYI this topic was already discussed on this thread http markmail.org thread 5wjjl6jx4yoxake5 After reading this discussion the next step is to provide the patches right No need for a patch Ð I see it in the thread. Thanks Thanks
