Do not consume the remaining response content if the connection is to be closed
I am working on a HttpClient-based application to send and receive potentially large files up to Gigabytes . When receiving large files the application allows the user to cancel the download at which time it closes the response input stream behind the scenes. The input stream currently provided by HttpMethodBase.getResponseBody for un-chunked responses with a known content length is a ContentLengthInputStream which automatically reads the remainder of the wrapped response instead of closing it straight away. This behaviour does not work well with very large files as the data is downloaded unnecessarily and the connection is held open for long very periods. Per the HTTP 1.1 spec section 14.10 it seems to me that either a server or a client in an HTTP 1.1 connection can use the Connection close directive to signal that a connection will be non-persistent and will therefore not require that all data be read before the connection can be released the cleaning up ContentLengthInputStream performs for persistent connections . http www.w3.org Protocols rfc2616 rfc2616-sec14.html sec14.10 Could HttpMethodBase be modified to check for this directive from the server or client and avoid wrapping the response input stream in ContentLengthInputStream when it is present It seems straight-forward though there may be side-effects I am not aware of. Diff against trunk file to add handling of Connection close for my specific use-case. Note that this is a minimal change purely to meet my needs. The Connection close directive should probably be checked in more cases than are covered in this diff.The request makes sense. The patch however currently breaks 3 test cases. James please submit patches in unidiff format diff -u .First off James what s wrong with just calling HttpMethod abort Secondly in my opinion there is a better fix for this issue if it does have to be fixed. The HttpMethodBase releaseConnection method is the proper place to deal with the issue. OlegOrtwin Sorry for the bad patch. I ll submit a better version once I can confirm it runs correctly against the latest SVN version and test cases. Oleg I initially tried both the HttpMethod abort and releaseConnection methods but both end up calling close on the response input stream and if this input stream is the ContentLengthInputStream it will block until the whole response is read. I suppose the releaseConnection method could be changed to perform differently in the case where the ContentLength wrapper is used but it seems easier not to add this wrapper in the first place rather than working around it later on. The advantage of leaving the input stream unwrapped in the Connection close case is that methods like abort and releaseConnection then close down the stream immediately without any further changes. The proposed changes act much like the existing code for the case when the response length is unknown. However I don t have a good understanding of how this approach might affect other aspects of the client so there could well be problems I don t appreciate... I initially tried both the HttpMethod abort and releaseConnection methods but both end up calling close on the response input stream With all due respect I do not think this observation is correct. See for yourself http jakarta.apache.org commons httpclient xref org apache commons httpclient HttpMethodBase.html 1008 I suppose the releaseConnection method could be changed to perform differently in the case where the ContentLength wrapper is used but it seems easier not to add this wrapper in the first place rather than working around it later on It s been a conscious design decision on our part that the consumer of HttpClient must not be able to close the underlying socket stream directly and I personally want to keep it this way. Besides this problem has nothing to do with the content-length delimited content streams. The problem equally affects chunk-encoded content streams. If the server responds with connection close there s no point in reading the stream to the end of stream regardless whether it is content-length delimited or chunk encoded. I hope this will point you in the right direction. OlegThanks Oleg You were exactly right about the abort method I thought I had tried that but must have been mistaken. My application toolkit only makes response input streams visible to users not the HttpMethod objects so I ve worked around my problem by wrapping the response input streams in my own class which aborts the method and releases the connection. This works fine.Here is what I think is the proper fix for the problem. At the same time I am a little wary of adding to the stable branch. Maybe this issue should be tackled in the 4.0 version OlegJames Oleg is right. The abort method was specifically designed for the purpose to let the user cancel a download. Oleg In my opinion the patch is a correct optimization of the releaseConnection method. It passes all current tests and I am confident that it does not break anything. To be sure we need some feedback from users with more complex setups like NTLM proxies. Those are the corner cases where changes like this one might cause problems. OdiMike Roland what do you think OlegHi Oleg the patch looks good. cheers   Roland Looks good to me. I have no problems applying this to 3.0 and 3.1. It s really just an optimization. I don t think it should cause any issues. MikeOdi Mike Roland I am having a second thought about this patch. Even though it does prove useful in some corner cases it actually negatively impacts performance in the most common use cases when the response content has been fully consumed or the connection can be kept alive . The invocation of the HttpMethodBase shouldCloseConnection method is far from being cheap. With this patch the method gets called twice for every response in the overwhelming number of cases. I suggest this issue be marked as WONTFIX or be dealt with in the 4.0 version. OlegI agree that shouldCloseConnection is non-trivial but I don t see calling it twice as a major performance issue. There s no IO or other blocking going on. There are probably plenty of places in 3.0 that do with some optimization but that has not really been the focus for 3.0 to date. The added benefit of this change outweights the minor performance hit in my book. Roland MikeHi Oleg Mike sorry for the late reply - I decided that I needed to spend some time away from any computers. I guess it would be possible to introduce a flag or something to avoid the double header parsing but I don t have the time to work on a patch. If it saves IO calls it s probably worth to apply this patch as it is. cheers   Roland I agree with Mike and Roland. Roland using a flag to shortcut a double call is probably impossible as the method depends a lot on the state which is likely to change between calls. OdiThis has been addressed as part of HTTPCLIENT-627.
