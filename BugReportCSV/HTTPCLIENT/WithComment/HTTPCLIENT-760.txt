Abort Before Execute Various Other Times Fails
With svn commit 639506 a few more scenarios become testable can be fixed. These are aborting before HttpClient.execute is called aborting between setting the connection request for aborting and setting the connection release trigger and aborting after a redirected route uses a new connection request. As of r639506 those three scenarios fail to abort correctly.Patch that tests fixes the three scenarios.I should mention the patch also has a minor API touchup of removing the InterruptedException declaration from the various execute methods. Since the only way it can happen is by an abort and it s possible that an abort may also cause an IOException it didn t make much sense to distinguish the exceptions. So now the potential InterruptedException is wrapped by an IOException consolidating the kinds of exceptions that can happen from an execute down to an HttpException and an IOException.Patch checked in. Many thanks Sam. The only change I did was re-throwing InterruptedException as InterruptedIOException instead of plain IOException Oleg
