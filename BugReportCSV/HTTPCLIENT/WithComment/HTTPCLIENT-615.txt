Consider making HostConfiguration immutable
HostConfiguration class should be immutable. This should also allow methods of this class to be non-synchronized. OlegHi Oleg good idea. I would also suggest to remove everything that identifies the host itself getHost getHostName getHostURL getPort getScheme By leaving only the actual configuration parameters in the class the same object can be applied to multiple hosts. If you feel that would be too much of a change for now I d tackle it early next year. cheers   Roland Here is a take on this one. All attributes in HostConfiguration are final there are no setters all synchronization is gone too. The copy constructor is gone since there is little point in duplicating an immutable object. The call in MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager is commented out. I didn t want to remove it as I will be grateful for any helpful comments in that class if I have to work on it. HostConfiguration still implements Cloneable as long as nobody creates a mutable subclass of InetAddress or HttpHost there shouldn t be a problem with shallow copies. I did not remove the target host from HttpConfiguration yet . I tried and had to realize that it would affect plenty of places most of them in MultiThreadedHCM. Changing DefaultHttpHostConnection to use separate HttpHost and HostConfiguration objects was not a problem. In MTHCM however HostConfiguration is used as a cache key. The current implementation basically pushes that local cache key implementation into the public API. I would still prefer to define a local cache key class passing host and config in as separate arguments. That shouldn t be a major problem when allocating connections but I m not sure how to reconstruct the cache key when a connection is released. Actually I m not even sure whether that is required at all. It just looked like something I d have to spend a lot more time on than I wanted to put into this patch. Also the connection manager parameters will probably be affected by this change. Let me know what you think about the patch as it is. I consider the second step less urgent. cheers   Roland The patch looks good. I am 1 to commit it. I am also not entirely happy with the way HostConfiguration is being used by MultiThreadedHCM as a cache key. For instance MTHCM currently does not take into consideration that fact that non-tunneled non-transparent proxy connections can be equivalently used to interact with any target host. This said I am reluctant to make any drastic changes until we get something functional first OlegPatch committed. Accidentally actually. I must take more care -
