Errors in character entities in Javadoc for HttpVersion
There are some errors in the Javadoc for the HttpVersion class. This is the class comment Ê p HTTP version as specified in RFC 2616. p Ê p Ê HTTP uses a ltmajor gt. ltminor gt numbering scheme to indicate versions Ê of the protocol. The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow Ê the sender to indicate the format of a message and its capacity for Ê understanding further HTTP communication rather than the features Ê obtained via that communication. No change is made to the version Ê number for the addition of message components which do not affect Ê communication behavior or which only add to extensible field values. Ê The ltminor gt number is incremented when the changes made to the Ê protocol add features which do not change the general message parsing Ê algorithm but which may add to the message semantics and imply Ê additional capabilities of the sender. The ltmajor gt number is Ê incremented when the format of a message within the protocol is Ê changed. See RFC 2145 36 for a fuller explanation. Ê p Ê p Ê The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field Ê in the first line of the message. Ê p Ê pre Ê HTTP-Version HTTP 1 DIGIT . 1 DIGIT Ê pre Ê p Ê Note that the major and minor numbers MUST be treated as separate Ê integers and that each MAY be incremented higher than a single digit. Ê Thus HTTP 2.4 is a lower version than HTTP 2.13 which in turn is Ê lower than HTTP 12.3. Leading zeros MUST be ignored by recipients and Ê MUST NOT be sent. Ê p Note that the character entities for less-than and greater-than are not properly ended with a semi-colon.
